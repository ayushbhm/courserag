history as opposed to the current update so what this is doing is as your training progresses your beta value.
increases right and as the beta value increases you give more and more weightage to the history right and in.
the initial phase you don't want to give lot of weightage to the history because your history is still building.
up right in your history is as unreliable as the current update right as the training progresses you want to.
give more value to the history right so that's the tip for adjusting the momentum so this is uh currently.
all I have for tips for learning rate and momentum as I said I'll revisit tips for learning rate towards.
the end of this lecture again okay so the next thing I want to do is talk about line search.
is again a simple idea now the whole issue that we have is that if you choose one learning rate.
and you're kind of married to it either learning rate is good then you would progress well if that learning.
