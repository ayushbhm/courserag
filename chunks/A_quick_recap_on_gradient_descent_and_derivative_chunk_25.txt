and all is a bit chaotic in terms of the interface okay so now let's see right so what is.
the derivative the derivative is the change in so I have written change in the function right so it's a.
change in the function by the change in the value right so what does the derivative capture as we had.
said it captures the sensitivity of the function to a change in the variable so if I change X by.
a small amount how much does the function change right so if you have x square then you know that.
if you change X from 2 to 2.5 still the square changes a bit quite a bit right it changes.
from 4 to 6.25 so although you have made only a 0.5 change in the value of x the square.
has changed by 2.25 right uh so that's that's what happens right so now let's look at what the so.
this is how I would note the gradient as so it is the movement in the y direction divided by.
the moment in the X direction right so in those regions now let's see this this here is a region.
