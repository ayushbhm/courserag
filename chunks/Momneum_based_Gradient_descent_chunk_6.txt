and this would become clear on the next slide so let me just do that and then come back uh.
to this slide right so what is is happening here so this is what my equation is right that UT.
and I was saying that UT is my history Vector so let's see how I'm constructing this UT so of.
course at time step 0 because my U minus 1 is not defined right so if I want to compute.
u0 I need beta times U minus 1 and there's no minus one step so I'm just going to set.
it to 0. so at time step equal to uh 0 this is how this will turn out right and.
this quantity is 0 so we'll just have uh U 0 is equal to the derivative of the loss function.
with respect to the parameter at time step 0. now let's see what U1 would be so U1 will be.
beta times u0 plus the current derivative so now if I substitute the value of U 0 then it would.
be beta times Delta the previous derivative plus W1 right so this is what I mean by the history now.
