derivative when you have a single variable function these are partial derivatives when you have a multi variable function and.
you're just taking the derivative with one variable treating the other as constant right that's why the derivative here disappears.
because you are taking the derivative of the b square part with w and it does not depend on W.
so hence the derivative will be so that is the partial derivative now the question is what is the gradient.
then the gradient is nothing but just the collection of the partial derivatives right so that gradient in this case.
would be 2W 2B right so it's the collection of all the partial derivatives is called the gradient right and.
in this case I have only two variables so I'll just have two partial derivatives so I'll collect them and.
I'll get the gradient vector and the gradient Vector is a two dimensional Vector in this case right so that's.
