want an island here right so it's very difficult right i mean like a very complex boundary so that all.
the blue points are separated from the uh orange points and we'll be okay if at least i can find.
some boundary right where the error is as small as it can be and i can live with that little.
error right so that's what i'm going to do i'm going to now start using the term minimize the error.
instead of saying that the error should be zero right so that's one switch i'm going to make right and.
now with this background we are ready to discuss what a typical supervised machine learning setup looks like not machine.
learning but supervised machine learning right so always given some data okay what is this data this is sum r.
n right these are vectors belonging to rn okay and this is some let's for the simplicity assume that it's.
just a real value it could again be a vector right it could be the case that given the data.
