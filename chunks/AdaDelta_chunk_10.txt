look at uh U T minus 1 and VT okay now U T minus 1 remember is one time step.
behind a VT so then one way of looking at it is that in ut minus 1 these all are.
participating right and in VT minus V T these all are participating because by this point the beta raised to.
K is so small that that guy is effectively not participating right because there's this one time step difference so.
this is what the situation is now what is happening if you look at this curve right so since all.
the gradients were high high and then they started decreasing my UT since it's looking at more High guys than.
the low guys right so because of this one time so so v v t has this current guy also.
which is again very small right and UT does not have this guy it has some other guy which was.
actually high right because it's one time step behind so now UT is going to be larger than VT does.
that make sense because VT is one step higher so once you enter the Steep regions after a while because.
