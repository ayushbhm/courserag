right and these ratings could be the imdb ratings or the critics rating or the rotten tomatoes rating right now.
deliberately i have moved to a setup where you have an input which is n-dimensional and now you have an.
output which is k dimensional which in this case is three dimensional right so just to make sure that you.
understand that it may not be always the case that we're just trying to predict one value using the same.
information about the input so just imagine that i have taken a lot of inputs a lot of movies from.
the past right and for each of these movies i have their input representation which is who was a director.
actor blah blah and then i also have the output and this output is just three dimensional right i have.
the imdb rating i have the critics rating and i have the rotten tomatoes it's all three are available to.
me and now using this input data right so this becomes my x comma y pairs i want to train.
