right I mean you don't really know in this case since it's a toy example we experimented with a few.
learning rates and we found out that for a particular learning rate it kind of uh stabilizes the point that.
I'm trying to make here is not that hey you should use RMS prop and then try to set the.
learning rate appropriately this may work in some examples but in some examples you may not be able to get.
the right learning rate right the point that I'm trying to make is in fact the opposite that RMS prop.
is indeed sensitive to the initial learning rate and if you don't set it properly then you could see oscillations.
despite the other properties of the algorithm which allows for a more smoother DK of the learning rate despite that.
good property it might still oscillate if the learning rate is not proper right so the main takeaway is that.
it is sensitive to the learning rate and setting this learning rate to 0.05 and showing you that it converges.
