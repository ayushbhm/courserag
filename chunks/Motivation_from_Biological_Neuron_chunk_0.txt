[Music] hi everyone so welcome to lecture two uh in this lecture we are going to talk about uh different.
neurons mcculloch pits neuron thresholding logic perceptrons and even look at the learning algorithm for perceptrons and see a small.
proof on why that algorithm would converge and then we'll end with what we call as multi-layer perceptrons or mlps.
which you would have popularly heard of and what is the representation power of such mlps right so let's uh.
start with the first module and we'll start with biological neurons right so why biological neurons right so what we.
are interested in knowing about is what is known as an artificial neuron which is the most fundamental unit in.
an artificial neural network right but now why the term artificial neuron right so where does this inspiration come from.
so the inspiration actually comes from biology so i think you remember when we were talking about history we had.
