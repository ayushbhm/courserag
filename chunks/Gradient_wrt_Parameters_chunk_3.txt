split it into two parts right so let's see I already know the derivative of the loss function with respect.
to this guy right which is uh a k i right this is the ith neuron in the kth layer.
I already know the derivative of the loss function with respect to that and so I can find the derivative.
of the loss function with respect to a k i I already have some formula for that from the previous.
lectures and then the derivative of a k i with respect to w k i j right now this how.
do I compute this is the question and this is again going to be very uh straight forward so let's.
see what that is it just turns out to be h k i j right so let's see why that.
is the case okay so now uh let's see a k again I'll take a simple case of a 2.
cross so Suppose there are only two neurons here or maybe let's take all the three neurons okay right and.
now this so this is the AK Vector I'm going to just ignore B K I'm just going to write.
