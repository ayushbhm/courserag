Matrix right so what is this I'm going to just substitute the right values of K and I so this.
is going to be derivative of K1 and then this is going to be K minus 1 1 this is.
the formula that we had computed on the previous slide right this was h of K minus 1 comma J.
so I'm just going to substitute the values of I and J right so this is of K and J.
so this is J and you already know K so this is what I get right so this uh I've.
just substituted everything from the previous slide onto this slide okay now let's look at notice something about this Matrix.
right so all the guys in this column all the terms that are getting multiplied are the same same for.
the next column all of these guys are the same next for same for the next column the other interesting.
thing is that across the rows the entries are the same right these three guys are the same these three.
guys are the same and these three guys are the same right so if I were to take say if.
