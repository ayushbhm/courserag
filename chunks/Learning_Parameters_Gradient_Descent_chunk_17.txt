the cosine of the angle is minus 1 that's when I will get the most negative value for this quantity.
which is my quantity of Interest right and when would the cosine be minus 1 when the angle between the.
two vectors is 180 degrees which two vectors the vector U and the gradient vector so that's where I get.
my U now I want you to be at 180 degrees with the gradient Vector that means I Want U.
to be opposite to the gradient Vector hence in gradient descent and this is something you would have heard a.
hundred times I move in the direction oppose it to the gradient right so this is how that formula or.
how that rule comes we started off with the Taylor series that gave us a certain condition on what a.
good use should be then we've pushed that condition to be to its limit right we wanted it to be.
less than zero but we said let it be as less as newer as it can be and we found.
that that happens when this happens okay and that happens when beta is equal to 180 degrees and beta is.
