[Music] okay so now let's build an intuition for the back propagation algorithm so so far we have answered the.
first part of the question which was how to choose the loss function and we have taken two popular problems.
classification and regression and motivated the choice for the loss function for both of them right now what we want.
to do is that once you know the loss function now we can start talking about the derivative of the.
loss function with respect to parameters right because that's the quantity that we are interested in if we know the.
derivative of the loss function with respect to the parameters for all the parameters on our network then we can.
simply plug it that back into the gradient descent algorithm and we are done right so that's all that we.
need to do but now in the case of a deep neural network this is i wouldn't say complicated but.
there is slightly more work involved than what we had in that simple network that we had right so here's.
