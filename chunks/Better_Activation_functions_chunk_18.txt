derivatives I would have had this red term common and then this blue term the blue term is always positive.
because it is the output of a sigmoid neuron so it has no say on the sign and then the.
sign is then determined by or other I mean it contributes equally I mean whatever it is all of it.
is positive the sign will just depend on the red part and the red part is same for all these.
guys so if the red part is negative all of them would be negative it's positive all of them would.
be positive right so a gradient Vector is either consisting all positive values or all negative values right so that's.
what is happening and the why am I discussing this in the case of sigmoid Duron because this happened because.
you had used sigmoid neurons hence the blue parts were always positive right if you had some use some other.
neuron which had a range between minus one to one then it would have been possible some of these Blues.
