kind of a one okay and what's the condition associated with that i have suffixed something there so it's this.
is what it looks like i equal to l so what that means is that if i is equal to.
l then this indicator will take on the value 1 otherwise it will take on the value 0. so that's.
what an indicator value variable means it just encodes this if else condition right so indicator variable is this is.
how you write it and it will take on the value one if the condition is satisfied that the condition.
in the suffix is satisfied otherwise not right so you can now agree that these two are the same right.
this is just a more compact way of writing that right okay so what do i have so far i.
have the derivative the partial uh derivative of one uh of the ayat da shaded green guy sorry the partial.
derivative of the loss function with respect to the ith shaded green guy right but we are all we are.
