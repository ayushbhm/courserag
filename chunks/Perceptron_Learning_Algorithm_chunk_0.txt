[Music] um welcome back so we are in the next module now where we'll be talking about the perceptron learning.
algorithm right so far we introduced the perceptron we saw that the decision boundary that the perceptron learns is linear.
and then we introduce this concept of error where if the weights are not proper or if w1 w2 values.
are not proper then you will make some errors in dividing the points into the right half spaces right so.
that's that's what we have learned so far but we did not talk about how did we get in this.
w1 wt we were mainly trying to adjust it by hand so now we look at the perceptron learning algorithm.
which allows us to learn these ways right so now before we do that let us try to understand that.
apart from implementing boolean functions right i mean which does not look very interesting right why would you care about.
boolean functions so what is it that the perceptron can be used for and what is this connection to the.
