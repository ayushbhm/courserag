p to be greater than equal to 0 and suppose it's less than 0 right suppose the condition has been.
violated okay so now what will i do we make the correction that my new weight vector is going to.
be the weight vector the current time step plus pi right that's what the correction that we are going to.
do is that correct okay now if i am going to make that correction so now let beta be the.
angle between w and w t plus 1. okay now what does cos of beta going to be it's going.
to be this dot product okay and why don't i have a w star here the norm of w star.
in the denominator because i had already assumed that w star is the normalized wake twitter right that means the.
norm is equal to 1 so i don't need to write that in the denominator okay so this is what.
cost beta is now let's just try to expand this right so i'll now look at the numerator alone uh.
let me just get rid of some stuff here so the numerator is uh w star the dot product between.
