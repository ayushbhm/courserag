composition gives you a better way and do this search in an Optimum way using some ideas from RL and.
then do you arrive at better activation functions right so they did this and the many activation functions popped out.
right so you can see for reference here this one looks somewhat like the elu gelu family right but there.
are other activation functions which also popped out and what they uh arrived it as that any function of this.
form which is X into sigmoid of a beta into X is a good activation function and this is actually.
uh the swish activation function and if you set the constant to 1.702 then you get uh gelu or if.
you make it a learnable parameter then you have uh the switch activation function right so they again when they.
try to search this they again arrived at this form which was similar to the form that gelu had and.
the generic form which is parametric is called Swish and if you set it to a specific value then you.
