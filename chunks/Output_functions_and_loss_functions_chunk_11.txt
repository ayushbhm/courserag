of regression now the next thing i'm going to do is talk about classification and to understand the loss function.
in the classification context you need to know about cross entropy so i have a separate video which is from.
a previous course which will point to so that would be kind of the preparation video for this lecture which.
talks about information content cross entropy and so on so you could see that video first before you look at.
the next part and we'll just put a link to that video here right okay so assuming that you have.
seen that video let's go to this discussion so now let us consider another example which is a classification problem.
so you are given an image and you want to classify it into say one of four categories right and.
now again what would uh what would the output you want to predict is you want to predict a probability.
distribution right so in the previous video the helper video that i just pointed you to uh we see that.
