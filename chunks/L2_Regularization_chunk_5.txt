you can minimize the loss but I do not want these W values to blow up because if these W.
values blow up my regularization term will blow up and hence my effective loss would still be high right so.
I am telling you that here you cannot allow the weights to grow in other words I am just drawing.
some kind of a boundary here and saying that the more you go out of this boundary right the more.
uh bigger my W1 and W2 are going to be the more bigger my L2 Norm is going to be.
of the weights and more bigger this loss term is going to be and hence my effective loss will not.
be minimized right so now I am saying that you add as many parameters as you want you add more.
model complexity you have a million parameters a billion parameters but for any given parameter I will not allow you.
to grow those values a lot because the moment you grow those values a lot then this loss term will.
