is ah much farther from the red curve so the bias is high whereas the blue curve is closer to.
the red curve so the bias is low right so informally we are seeing that simple models have a high.
bias and complex models have a low bias right so let us continue with the discussion and now we will.
Define one more quantity which is the variance right and variance is something that I think most of you know.
so variance is just the expectation of the of how far is a given value away from the expected value.
right so what does that mean so you have this ah suppose you take any one blue line from here.
and then you had that green line or the green curve which was the average right maybe I should have.
used the right colors let me just use the right colors yeah so suppose I take any one of these.
blue lines from here and then I had the green curve which was the average right and it looks something.
