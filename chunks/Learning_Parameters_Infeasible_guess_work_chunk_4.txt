notation capital n for the number of training pairs and small n for the number of inputs that i have.
the small n is equal to 1 in this case right so this is the training data that i have.
now my training objective as i said is going to be that when i make predictions and these are the.
true values and these are the prediction values i want the difference between them to be as small as possible.
so this is my difference function and this i'm going to calculate over all the training points take the average.
and i'm going to define that as my loss function and my objective is to find w and b right.
such that my loss function is minimized right so that's an english explanation of this entire expression written here minimize.
with respect to w and b which means find the values of w and b which minimizes this quantity and.
this is how this quantity is defined it's the average difference of the predictions from the two values for all.
