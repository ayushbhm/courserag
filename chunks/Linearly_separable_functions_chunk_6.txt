idea of what i mean right it cannot find a line which separates the positive points from the negative points.
okay so now with a single perceptron we cannot do this right now what i am going to show is.
that with a network of perceptrons you can do that with the network of perceptrons whatever a network means i.
have not defined what a network means we will define that with that you can separate positive points from negative.
points even if the data is not linearly separable to begin with right but before we see that so you.
start with this question right so how many boolean functions can you design from two inputs so let me start.
with some easy ones and then we'll try to calculate the number of functions and i once i show you.
a few patterns you should be able to guess the number of functions so these are two inputs given to.
the u and here's one function that you know which is the always off function similarly the always on function.
