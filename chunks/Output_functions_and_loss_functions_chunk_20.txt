the original value is negative so e raised to minus 10 is going to be 1 over e raised to.
10 and this is still going to be a positive value right so i've taken the original computations al that.
i had have been able to convert that into a probability distribution using the softmax function i've also explained what.
the softmax function looks like and just want to talk about uh one more thing here right so you could.
have asked me that why did why did you do this e raised to x right i mean why did.
you raise every value to the exponent and then did that why couldn't i have just taken every value here.
right for example for this guy take 10 and then divide it by the sum of the remaining elements would.
that have not been enough right and obviously the answer is no because then for this guy which would have.
been minus 10 divided by minus 10 plus 10 plus 20 plus 30 the answer would have been some negative.
