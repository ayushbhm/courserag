one combination of w one w two w naught which satisfies these inequalities of course in practice i would not.
like to do this randomly but have a learning algorithm which does it and we will go there we will.
go to the perceptron learning algorithm but for now it's ok if i just think a bit about it and.
i have already thought about it and this is a set of values which i am going to give you.
if w not equal to 1 also not 1 sorry this should have been minus 1 right so this should.
have been minus 1 so if w not equal to minus 1 if w 1 equal to 1.1 and w.
t equal to one point one then all these equations are satisfied you can just plug in these values and.
see that all the four inequalities are satisfied right and now i'll look at the geometric interpretation of that so.
what is the geometric interpretation i am saying that minus 1 okay plus 1.1 into x1 plus 1.1 into x2.
greater than equal to 0 this is the positive half space less than 0 this is the negative half space.
