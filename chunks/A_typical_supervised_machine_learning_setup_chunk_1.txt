i want to have an algorithm which can learn these weights but before i had done the perceptron learning algorithm.
i had taken a slight detour and spoken about errors right because that was important to understand the error because.
the whole point of the algorithm was that whenever you make an error you do some correction right and that's.
why understanding error was important here also there is something similar so i'm going to revisit the concept of error.
again and then from there start working towards the algorithm right so but uh in this video we'll not do.
the algorithm we'll just do the machine learning setup right so let's look at that so coming going back to.
the perceptron algorithms and seen these kind of data distributions there and i had said that this is not linearly.
separable of course it is not and we had said that a single perceptron cannot deal with this data right.
