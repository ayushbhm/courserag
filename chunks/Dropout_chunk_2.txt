in the last video is useful how do you use it in the context of deep learning right so the.
two challenges are that at training time your cost is high and even a test time your cost is high.
right irrespective of whether you use option one or option two right so Dropout actually addresses both these issues so.
what it does is it effectively allows us to train several neural networks without incurring the cost of actually training.
K neural networks right and we'll see how exactly it does that and it also at inference time we don't.
need to pass the test instance to several networks we just need to pass it through one neural network but.
just do a simple trick to get the averaging effect right so we'll see how that works so the idea.
in Dropout is that you have this original Network which I have shown on the left hand side you drop.
out some units from it that means you drop out some new neurons from it so this is I've dropped.
