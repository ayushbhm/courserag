just get your hands a bit dirty with this okay yeah so now we have the gradient descent rule that.
the direction U that we intend to move in should be at 180 degrees with respect to the gradient in.
other words move in the direction opposite to the gradient so this phrase I'm sure you have heard a million.
times but now you know where this phrase comes from uh and this is what my update would look like.
whatever is my current value of w uh sorry whatever is my current value of w I just take the.
gradient or the derivative right and then move in the direction opposite to that because of the minus here and.
by a small conservative step because of ETA and this ETA comes from the fact that Taylor series works well.
in a small neighborhood hence we are using a small ETA there right now this year if I put it.
in a vector this is nothing but Theta t plus 1 okay maybe not the best choice of colors here.
if I put this in a vector this is Theta t and if I put this quantity in a vector.
