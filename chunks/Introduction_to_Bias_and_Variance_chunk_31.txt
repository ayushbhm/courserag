you do other way of looking at it is that you want low variance but at the same time you.
don't want a high bias in the model right so you want like reasonable variance reasonable bias so that your.
different models are not far off from each other at the same time your model is not far off from.
the true uh function that you have it so that's why this trade-off is there that you want medium variance.
and medium bias right and turns out ah that both bias and variants actually contribute to the mean square error.
right so let's see what the mean square error is of course we have seen it a million times but.
let us see again in the context of bias and variance right so I'll end this video here and then.
we'll talk about uh mean square error in the next video.
