boolean functions so what is it that the perceptron can be used for and what is this connection to the.
body and functions right so let's uh let's revisit our example right so now we are again talking about the.
case of a binary classifier and we want to decide whether to watch a movie or not right and suppose.
we are given a list of m movies all the past movies that we had seen along with the class.
label whether we liked this movie or did not like this ok this is based on our past data so.
this is just a binary label on all the movies right and each movie could be represented by n features.
so these features could simply be the inputs which are contributing to the decision so one input is actor daemon.
the other input is the genre thriller and so on and these are all boolean inputs that we have and.
you could also have some real valued inputs like the imdb rating the critics rating of the movie and so.
