can take outside ah so now if you look at it this is the quantity that I was interested in.
and I did not know how to estimate it but now I have been able to rewrite that quantity in.
terms of things here and here I see some hope now because now I have this y hat and Y.
here which is just the training data that was given to me those are the Y's and the predictions that.
are my model made so this is something I can estimate expectation of Epsilon Square I can estimate it's just.
the I'd already assumed that Epsilon comes from the normal distribution right so expect expectation of Epsilon square is just.
going to be Sigma Square so that I can compute again here I have a slight problem but we will.
come back to this right so I have just now Rewritten the quantity of interest in terms of a set.
of quantities of which some quantities I can compute and there is one quantity which I can still not compute.
but we will see how to deal with that ok so now what we will do is now we will.
