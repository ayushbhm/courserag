that is what my ah average error is going to be but what I am defining as the bias is.
that whatever is the average value right that divided by sorry that minus the True Value right so that's what.
the bias is so the bias is defined as the expected value of the prediction minus the True Value that.
you would have had right so that's what the bias is so in simple terms this quantity here is the.
green ah value and this is the red value right so that is what you are defining as the ah.
expected uh as the bias okay now what is clear is that for the simple model the average value is.
very far from the True Value that means the bias is going to be very high for a simple model.
ah whereas for the complex model the bias is going to be low because the average value which is the.
blue curve is very close to the red curve right so bias is the difference between the average value or.
the expected value of the model ah so why is there an expectation here because where is the randomness coming.
