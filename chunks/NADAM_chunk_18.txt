for right so that's that's all about madame uh so now which Optimizer to use I think uh uh the.
most common I guess the default one that I have seen in most papers is Adam if you don't know.
anything maybe just go with Adam however there are recent Works which are not so recent also there also three.
to four years old now which do point out some issues with Adam still by far at least for all.
the Practical work that I've seen Adam seems to be a very common choice and if not Adam one of.
the variants of Adam right maybe an Adam or uh yeah I think Madame is another good choice right so.
uh if you don't if you're a new learner just use off-the-shelf optimization optimizers and or Adam is as good.
a choice as any and some of them you could then practice a bit more so people have reported that.
just using gradient descent and then using or maybe momentum based gradient descent and then really knowing how to set.
