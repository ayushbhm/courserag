now similarly you can compute the derivative of B and you can see that all of this is same the.
only thing extra here is this x i and that is coming from the fact that you had W X.
plus b so when you take the derivative with respect to W this x is what you get but when.
you take the derivative with respect to B you don't get this x that you just get 1 here that's.
why you are having this uh into 1 here and into X there right so now you have the formula.
for Delta uh for the uh partial derivative of the loss function with respect to W and the partial derivative.
of the loss function with respect to B right so you have both of these and now we can construct.
an algorithm out of this okay so let's see what that algorithm is so I started off wow so this.
I hope you can see it so these were the two points given to me these are the same two.
points that we have been looking at since the last lecture so x equal to 0.5 where the value of.
