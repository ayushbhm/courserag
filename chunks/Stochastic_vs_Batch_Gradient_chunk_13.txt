then moving uh in that direction right or the opposite to that the direction of the gradient but here that.
is not what I am doing and I'm asking every point this point say hey go here go here go.
here go here and so on that's why I'm oscillating uh that's why you see the oscillations right uh and.
as I mean as the case and a parameter which is a favorable for one point may not be a.
favorable for the next points that's why this point moved you here and then the next Point said no no.
no come back here then again go back here go back here and so on and that's why you keep.
oscillating like that right now can we reduce the oscillations by improving our stochastic estimates right so currently our estimate.
is taken from one point right we have taken n equal to one now instead of one if I take.
10 if I take 20 then would these oscillations reduce right what this uh I would would I please take.
closer to the green curve right I know in the limit if I take n equal to all the points.
