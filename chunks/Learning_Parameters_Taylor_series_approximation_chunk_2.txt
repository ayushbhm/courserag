the case I don't know what the correct Theta is so I'm going to start off with some random value.
for Theta and when I start off with this random value of theta I want to know how much to.
change it so that at this Step at least I'm looking at it one step at a time at this.
Step at least the error should decrease right so I'm looking for that change in Theta which is nothing but.
a change in W and a change in B so that I get a new value of theta and then.
my loss is hopefully decreased I'm not sure of that yet but that's what the goal is right so this.
is my Theta some Vector Delta Theta is also a vector it is also a vector in R2 this is.
a vector in R2 and similarly this is also a vector in R2 right now these are two vectors now.
what I'm going to do is my change is going to be just given as Theta Nu is equal to.
wherever I am currently I'll move by this change right so Theta Nu is equal to theta plus Delta Theta.
