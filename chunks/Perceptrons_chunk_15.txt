not right in other situations it could be reflected to uh it could be adjusted to reflect the prior as.
we say right so what is the without knowing the data without knowing the inputs what is the prior that.
is about you taking this decision as a positive versus negative right zero versus one so that's why it's called.
the prejudice and the same thing i have explained on the slides you can go back and read it later.
right okay so now coming to the question so this is this was to motivate a few things right that.
why are we interested in boolean functions because many real world problems you can map it to boolean functions then.
why do we have weights because in many real function world problems you want weighted inputs you want certain inputs.
to be more important than others and what is theta what is the prior so that has also been explained.
right now let's move on to a different set of questions so what kind of functions can be implemented using.
