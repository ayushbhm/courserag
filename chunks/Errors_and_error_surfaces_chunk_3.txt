zero or less than equal to zero which of these inequalities is satisfied okay so these these points line the.
negative half space as shown in the red region and then of course one of the points which should not.
have been in the negative half space which is the point one comma 1 is lying in the negative half.
space so with these particular values of the perceptron or the weights of the perceptron function I am making error.
on one of the four inputs right so if I just want to tabulate so I took the W and.
W2 values as minus 1 minus 1 and then I made an error of one of the inputs now let.
me take the values 1.5 and 0 okay let me try those values so I will oops yeah I'll make.
this as 1.5 ok so this is 1.5 and I want W2 to be 0 so I'll just make it.
0. okay so this is the line that I get and I do not of course I have fixed at.
minus one and again you can see the negative and the positive half spaces so I'm again making an error.
