am ignoring the biases okay so I get some hidden layer H1 right and then from the hidden layer I.
am reconstructing X hat as say W Times H1 okay this is what I am doing in this network right.
my input layer I am doing first a linear transformation followed by a non-linearity and then whatever H1 I get.
I just reconstructed the X hat from there if you want I can just add the bias also here and.
I can add the bias here also right so you if you want that's that makes you more comfortable then.
that is what it is right now suppose I am able to do this in a way that I am.
able to reconstruct X hat from X perfectly that means my error is zero what does that tell you about.
H1 so so it tells you that H1 actually character captures all the information that was there in X right.
because I have done a compression I have gone from one zero to four dimensions to 256. now we know.
that in many applications our input has a lot of redundancy right so I would have captured weight height and.
