this and I have substituted that those values in the equation and then just counted the number of errors that.
I made so we were doing that visually but I could just write a program to calculate those errors and.
that's how the code there was displaying it there was two errors one errors and so on and now these.
are the set of values for w and W2 if I plug in these values and you can go back.
and check them the error would be 0. these are here right these are the values of w one and.
ah W 2 right for which the error is going to be 1 and so on 2 and 3. so.
what I have done here is I have actually ah yeah so the question here is for this particular case.
can the error not be 4 right so now you can see so any line that you draw okay so.
the only possibilities are that all the Four Points lie in the uh in the positive half space in which.
case you would be making an error on three points or all the Four Points lie in the negative half.
