that uh you can play the video again and you can see that it's taking quite a few u-turns before.
it reaches its goal and this is exactly the analogy very good if it's on a scooter or a bike.
or a car and it is going fast an overshoot come back overshoot come back but what is happening in.
this case as happens in real life also you will still reach your goal faster than the guy who is.
walking right in this case so momentum base gradient descent oscillates in and out of the Minima Valley as the.
momentum carries it out of the valley right and then it takes a lot of u-turns before finally converging despite.
these used U turns it still converges faster than the gradient vanilla gradient descent right and I'll just quickly play.
the video Once More to show this is important right so after 50 iterations momentum based gradient descent is at.
a very low loss whereas gradient descent was a very high loss right and 50 iterations corresponds to two seconds.
