of these unary and binary operators right these are easier to Define there's a limited space of unity operators that.
I consider a limited space of binary operators that I consider of course there are many possibilities here but if.
I restrict that search space and then try out all these combinations and then try to see which one gives.
me the best performance then can I discover better activation functions and this requires some sort of reinforcement learning which.
is beyond on the scope of this but what you can think right at a Layman level this is how.
how you could understand it there's a large space of functions right and you uh You observe that these functions.
are composed of certain operations so can you compose functions in different ways right and then try to see which.
composition gives you a better way and do this search in an Optimum way using some ideas from RL and.
