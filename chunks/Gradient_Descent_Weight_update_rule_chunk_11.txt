function because I have not even told you very clearly what the loss function is in so far in the.
discussion if you're just working with a generic function L of w so we now need to look at the.
what the actual loss function is right so here's coming back to our original example where we had two parameters.
W and B this was our function okay and our loss function was defined as this right that let's assume.
there is only one point there's only one data point so a loss function was summed over all the points.
and then take in the average but now I assume that there's only one data point so there's no summation.
here and summed over what it was the prediction minus the true and the square of that right so that's.
what this formula is f of x is our approximation Y is the true value so I am taking the.
difference between the two and squaring it right and there's one by two I've just kept for some convenience it.
