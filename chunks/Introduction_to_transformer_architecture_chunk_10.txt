then takes in the final representation so ignore this for some reason this s2s1 is showing up on the slide.
it's not supposed to but it continues to show up oh no yeah so this is the final State and.
then it's passed to the decoder and then the decoder again does this sequential processing right and then of course.
I don't have much of a choice because I produce the first output which say in this case is none.
and then that has to be fed to the next state anyways right so the decoder uh this processing will.
still happen sequentially because I need to know what was produced and then feed it as the next input so.
unlike here where the entire input was available at one go here the input itself right is being generated one.
step at a time so I'll have to do a sequential processing right but then the encoder can I do.
something to speed up the computation is what my uh question is right so we'll go towards answering that question.
