those curve drawn a curve through those hundred points right so this is what it looks like and now if.
I um foreign so this is what happens for RMS property so sorry earlier uh yeah when we're looking at.
the case of uh VT using the average norm in even in RMS prop we use our average normal so.
I'm comparing RMS prop with a version of RMS prop which uses L Infinity Norm instead of the L2 Norm.
right so in the case of RMS prop the learning rate is continuously increasing in this case okay and now.
let's see what is happening in the case of uh the max version of RMS Pro right so the learning.
rate is increasing more smoothly in this case as opposed to uh in the case of RMS okay so that's.
that brings us to the update rule of this Max prop right which is the version of RMS prop with.
the using the max Norm for VT as opposed to the L2 norm and that's it right so this is.
as simple as it gets you just replace the uh L to num by the max norm and we can.
