w exists i'm sure about that and i'm going to call that w star it's just that i don't know.
what that w star is but i can assume the existence of such a w star right so that's the.
w star that i'm going to use right we don't know what it is but it exists right now suppose.
at some time step t uh we inspected the point p i right what does that mean i have points.
p1 p2 all the way up to such some pm which are belonging to my set p prime right these.
are all the points and at every point inside that loop i'm going to randomly pick up one point right.
so that lets that point be pi so i'm at the t iteration of the loop and the point which.
i have picked up is p i okay and we found that the condition is violated we wanted w transpose.
p to be greater than equal to 0 and suppose it's less than 0 right suppose the condition has been.
violated okay so now what will i do we make the correction that my new weight vector is going to.
