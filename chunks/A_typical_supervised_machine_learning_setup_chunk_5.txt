one party or the other and if you make some error in that prediction like 20 of the people you.
predict wrongly it won't make much of a difference right so it would still give you some rough idea of.
how the election is going right and in many cases of course unless it's a very closely fought election but.
in most cases if the error is around fighting person you can live with it right so from now on.
we are going to live with this idea of error that error may not always go to zero and our.
goal would be to just minimize the error as much as possible right so if i were to actually have.
a zero error here i would need something very complex right so i would want a decision boundary uh which.
perhaps i don't know looks something like this right and now even that is not enough uh yeah i just.
want an island here right so it's very difficult right i mean like a very complex boundary so that all.
