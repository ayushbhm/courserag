uh understanding now and this is where I'm going to draw the line right so my argument for that would.
be that ETA is small so ETA square is going to be even smaller hence I can ignore this ETA.
Q would be even smaller so all of this I can ignore right so since ETA is small I'm just.
going to cut the derivative or cut the formula here and I'll just use the linear approximation and we have.
just seen previously that when ETA is small a linear approximation is good enough right so I have reason at.
least I have shown you geometrically that I can do that okay so this is what I'm going to do.
okay now ah this move right this is the move that I have made I was comfortably at some value.
of theta there was a certain loss there and I decided to make this move now this move would be.
favorable only if what is the condition that I would want I have moved and I would call the move.
to be favorable only if so only if this value is less than this value right otherwise it's not favorable.
