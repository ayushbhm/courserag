bad but they're very good in a small neighborhood around the point right that's the main in the small neighborhood.
yeah my approximations are quite good right so that's the main thing you need to understand about the Taylor series.
okay so now let's go ahead uh and see what happens if you have a 2d function right so I.
had earlier now I was just dealing with L of uh w now what if I have L of w.
comma B right and in this case instead of w comma B I just have X comma y right for.
convenience uh those are the two axes that I have taken okay but I just the main point is if.
you want to move to two variables right so now yeah so this is what the curve looks like okay.
and let me just delete my annotations yeah so this is what the curve looks like now again if I.
do a linear approximation as you can see here I'm doing a linear approximation then what I'll get is a.
line in 2D it would just be a plane right so I've just approximated the function by a plane and.
