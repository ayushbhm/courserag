functions better the approximation okay so now this is what has happened in the previous slide I had this I.
constructed a tower and I placed it at a certain position on the x-axis and that is where it is.
I constructed one more Tower it was at a different position one more Tower at a different position so I've.
just shown you some of the towers in those large number of towers that I had right now I could.
you could imagine that I would have one more uh right say one more Tower here which would look something.
like this and it should go up and come here like this right so I've not shown you all the.
towers that were there on the previous slide but this is what is happening right you are constructing many of.
these towers independently then just adding them all up to get the main function that you are trying to approximate.
right and all of these are similar except for their position on the x-axis and for their Heights or lengths.
