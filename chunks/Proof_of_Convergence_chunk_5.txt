just constructed the single set which is a collection of all the points for which the only condition that i.
need to satisfy now is w transpose p should be greater than equal to zero for all the points in.
p prime where p prime is as defined on this slide right so just a simple change nothing uh great.
here right this will just uh simplify some of the proof that some of the steps in the proof right.
okay so i'll start with the algorithm so p is all the inputs with label one n is all the.
inputs with label zero n is this negative of and minus is the set which contains the negations of all.
points in n and now i'm defining p prime as a union of p and n minus right and now.
i'm going to initialize w randomly again i'll have this convergence condition and what i'm going to do i'm going.
to pick up a random p a random point belonging to p prime where p prime is the union defined.
above so what am i going to do till it does not converge i'm going to pick up a random.
