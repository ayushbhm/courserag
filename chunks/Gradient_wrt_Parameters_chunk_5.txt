I get it by multiplying this by this right so if I open that up it's going to be w.
k 2 1 into h11 plus w k 2 2 into H 1 2 plus w k 2 3 into.
h 2 3 and plus there would be this bias term right which would be B oh okay 2 in.
this case Okay so that's that's what it is going to be and now I'm taking the derivative of this.
quantity with respect to uh one of the weights right so what is the weight that I am looking at.
I'm looking at w k i j in which this case the wkij is w k 2 2. so all.
of these other terms are going to disappear right that's why I said the bias would matter in fact more.
terms don't matter and the derivative of this quantity with respect to w k 2 is just going to be.
H 1 2 right and now let's understand what is uh H what is this what are these indices one.
and two here so this was just the uh I and J right so that's what this one and two.
are so I was trying to take the derivative of uh a I was trying to take the derivative of.
