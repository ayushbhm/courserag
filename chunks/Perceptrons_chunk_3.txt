try to answer over the course of this lecture so so you had this mp neuron or the mecolic bits.
neuron and then came this perceptron right which was proposed by frank rosenblatt again we had seen this in the.
history around 1958 and the main differences were the falling and they are some of them are already obvious in.
the diagram itself that earlier the neurons the inputs are only boolean but now the inputs could also be real.
that was one difference the other was that now you have these weights right so these weights could tell you.
which inputs are more important than the other and there's also now that you have these weights there's also a.
mechanism or a learning algorithm to learn these weights right so you might vaguely have an idea of which inputs.
are important which are not but typically you would want to learn this from data that in the past maybe.
while making decisions i have given more importance to who is the actor in the movie as opposed to who.
