the number of lectures that we had so but you could refer to my older lectures and auto encoders if.
you want and whatever we need I'll anyways cover in the next few slides right so I'll not have you.
have not had a detailed discussion or to encoders but I'll just quickly brush up on whatever I need in.
the next few slides right so two points here one is the original paper talks in the context of rbms.
I am going to talk about this idea in the context of Auto encoders we have not done Auto encoders.
in this offering of the course but I'll just quickly cover the concepts that I require right so now consider.
this deep neural network where there is like a 4 layer Network plus the input and the output layer and.
as I was saying before 2006 it was hard to train networks which are four five six layers and so.
