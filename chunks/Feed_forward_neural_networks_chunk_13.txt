3 okay this is actually equal to the vector a right and how am i computing that i have b.
1 1 b 1 2 b 1 3 plus so this is also a vector okay because i have three.
biases one bias for every neuron in neuron in this layer then i have w what was the dimension of.
w it was a three cross three uh matrix i am going to squeeze it in here so i have.
w1 this is the weight layer 1 matrix then the first element of it w 1 1 2 w 1.
1 3 right and then w 2 1 w 1 2 1 w 1 2 2 w 1 2 3.
w 1 3 1 okay let me just write this one all the way up to w 1 3 3.
right so this is a 3 cross 3 matrix and that's going to get multiplied by x what is x.
x again has three components the input x one x two x three right so this is how a is.
going to be computed it's a simple matrix vector multiplication so this is a matrix vector multiplication and followed by.
a addition with a vector and all the dimensions here make sense right so a is equal to r a.
