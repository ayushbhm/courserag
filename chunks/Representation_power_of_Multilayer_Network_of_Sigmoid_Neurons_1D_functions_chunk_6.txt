develop during this lecture okay so now let me just delete this and let me just put it on the.
slides so in other words I'm just going to read it out as it is in other words there's a.
guarantee that for any function f of x that's what I was showing that is a function which takes an.
N variable input and produces an M variable output in my example uh sorry M dimensional output in my example.
M was just one right I was just producing a single dimensional output we can always find a neural network.
with one single hidden layer and many neurons right I don't know how many neurons it would have but I.
can find a network with a with a single hidden layer and a large number of neurons such that the.
output would always satisfy this condition right now this is a very very powerful theorem right and this is what.
uh makes deep learning so attractor right so what is it saying right we are take any complex reliable function.
