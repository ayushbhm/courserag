the cases now when they concatenate I again get a five and two dimensional output right and this I could.
again pass it through whatever uh transformation I want right for example I could choose a 512 cross 1024 I.
could choose a 512 plus 256 or I could choose a 512 cross 512 right and depending on that I.
will know what my output Dimension would be if I choose this then my Z final Z is coming out.
of here would be 5 and 2 dimensional right so let's just understand it correctly so this H1 gave me.
a 256 dimensional Z1 this through this network or through this self-attention it I got another 256 dimensional H1 and.
then I got 512 dimensional uh output here which then again I pass it through a linear transformation right so.
it's because you're going to concatenate it makes sense that you the output of each of these is small right.
because if each of these is five and two dimensional then you concatenate you will keep going larger right and.
