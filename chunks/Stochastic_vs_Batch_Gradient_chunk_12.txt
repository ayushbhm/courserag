trying to push the parameter so I have a million data points right and I look at one of the.
training uh instances one of the points and I compute the gradient and this point says Hey to decrease the.
loss with respect to uh my values you need to move here right then the second Point comes I again.
Ask it hey what should the gradient would be and it again pushes me in Direction which is favorable to.
it so each point is acting independently and trying to move you in a direction which is most convenient for.
itself right and that's why you see these all oscillations they're not working together as opposed to in the gradient.
descent where all of them I'm asking all of them at one go taking the average of their consensus and.
then moving uh in that direction right or the opposite to that the direction of the gradient but here that.
is not what I am doing and I'm asking every point this point say hey go here go here go.
