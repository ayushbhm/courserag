minus log y hat 2 okay and that's why this i am trying to compute the derivative of y hat.
2 with respect to some ith element right it could be a l 1 a l 2 a l 3.
anything right so now i'm asking does y hat to depend on all these a's or does it only depend.
on one of them right because earlier we saw that the loss function depended on only on one of the.
y hats and not the entire vector for all the other elements the derivative was 0 but now for y.
hat 2 which is this green guy not the loss function right this shaded green guy does it depend on.
everything every element of a it does right because how did you compute y hat y hat was computed using.
the soft max function so y hat 2 in particular was e raised to a l 2 divided by the.
summation of e raised to all a i's right so it depends on all the ais because all the ai.
ali's appear in the denominator right so it's a function of all the allies right this is how we had.
