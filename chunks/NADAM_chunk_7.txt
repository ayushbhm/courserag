right which is M of T minus 1 it is used twice right first it is being used to make.
this temporary update to the value okay you make that temporary update and then switch back to the original value.
again right we because you are not using the temporary value again right so you're switching back to the original.
value so using the B time not here and then again you are using beta I am not here and.
then again you are switching back from this temporary computed value that you had to the original value that you.
have right so you're making some extra computations here which could be our uh kind of done away with that's.
the goal that we want to achieve while giving you the same effect right so now what is happening here.
is that you look at G1 and it's getting some input which was W1 and then it is subtracting some.
quantity from it instead if I already had passed it a value which was already equal to this right because.
