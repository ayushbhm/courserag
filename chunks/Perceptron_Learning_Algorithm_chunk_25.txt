here it has already become less than 90 but i don't care about it all i care about is the.
angle is decreased now let me pick up another point and this time maybe i picked up n1 right and.
now with n1 i again need to apply correction because you can see that the angle is actually quite small.
right it's forget about greater than 90 is actually quite small so i need to again change it and my.
adjustment would be w into w is equal to w minus x and when i get do that i get.
this new w right and i can again see that the angle has increased okay now let me do again.
pick a random point and say it was n3 no correction is needed because you can see that n3 is.
already making an obtuse angle with the weight vector right so no correction is needed because the condition is already.
satisfied again i pick up a random point it's n2 so again n2 is already safe because the angle seems.
to be greater than 90 degrees so i don't need to do any correction now i pick up the point.
