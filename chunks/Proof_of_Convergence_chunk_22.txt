the number of times i have updated my weight vector and this is the quantity that i wanted to handle.
on this is the quantity that i wanted to show was finite i wanted to show that k cannot tend.
to infinity okay now cos beta is going to be greater than or cos beta is going to grow proportional.
to square root of k so now as k increases cos beta will increase right now if k becomes arbitrarily.
large if it goes to infinite that means my algorithm is not converging it's it's keeping on updating then what.
will happen to cos beta cos beta will keep on increasing but can cos beta keep on increasing no cos.
beta is bounded between uh minus one and one right so cos beta has to be less than equal to.
one so cos beta cannot grow infinitely that means k cannot go infinitely k has to be bounded by a.
maximum number hence we have shown that k is a finite number so if the data is linearly separable right.
