in a vector this is nothing but Theta t plus 1 okay maybe not the best choice of colors here.
if I put this in a vector this is Theta t and if I put this quantity in a vector.
then this is the gradient of the loss function with respect to Theta right okay at time step T right.
at the time step T right so now let's try to again uh clarify the notation so this are the.
entire thing I can write in Vector form that's what I've just shown now some more clarification so what does.
this quantity Delta WT mean right so Delta WT is the partial derivative of the loss function which is a.
function of two variables W and B with respect to W and then evaluated at w is equal to WT.
and B is equal to BT what does that mean so now if I have the function is W square.
plus b square then the formula would be 2W 2B right this is what the formulaic representation of the gradient.
would be but now I can evaluate this at the current value of my w right so I'll just substitute.
