with respect to H1 and I just computed now I want to compute the derivative of the loss function with.
respect to A1 so for that the two con the quantity that I need is the derivative of the loss.
function with respect to H1 right and apart from that I need this simple quantity which I just showed is.
easy to compute right so that's if I just keep going one by one at every stage I have all.
the quantities that I wanted to uh want or want at that stage for computing the quantity of Interest right.
so now at this point you should be convinced that we have a generic formula for computing the derivative of.
the loss function with respect to the hidden layer no matter where the hidden layer is the first hidden layer.
second third fourth everyone we have this formula so we are almost done and now we'll reach the final part.
in our uh chain rule so let's look at that in the next module.
