saturate and if they saturate then the training kind of becomes problematic because the gradients are not flowing through right.
and if if the neuron is saturating with a value one that means actually these weights were like uh strongly.
participating in the output right and hence they would have had some impact on the loss function but that signal.
will not flow back to these weights because the derivatives have died right so that's a serious problem so this.
could lead to challenges during training since this is not a good the next problem is that sigmoids are not.
a zero Center that's again obvious from the plot because the plot is from zero to one zero centered would.
be something like say from example minus one to one so there is a zero in between so it's equally.
distributed around zero whereas this itself starts from zero and goes to one so the center is around 0.5 right.
so what if it's not zero center right what could the possible what could the problem be right so now.
