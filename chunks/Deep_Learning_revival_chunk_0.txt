foreign [Music] functions and initialization methods and these are all geared towards making deep learning or deep neural networks train.
better right so we'll first do a quick recap set the context about why we are talking about activation functions.
and initialization methods and then introduce a bunch of activation functions as well as initialization methods okay so let's start.
with a quick recap as I said so uh when you train neural networks so we started with this very.
simple Network which had just one parameter W in fact we started with two parameters wnb but I've just kept.
one parameter and we already saw how to train this network the idea was to use gradient descent or any.
of its variants and the main ingredient there was to update the weight using some kind of an update rule.
which internally contained the derivative right so this is the quantity that was important and we saw various variants of.
