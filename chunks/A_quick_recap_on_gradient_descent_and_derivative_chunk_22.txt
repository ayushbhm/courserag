will change by a large value so say w was uh here it will change by a large value and.
go somewhere here and my B will also change by a large value and go somewhere else so hence now.
if I look at the original point where I was which I'll now Mark as red right this is where.
I was and if my Delta W and Delta B were large then I'll move to a point which is.
farther away from it right so that is what will happen that means these Delta quantities that you see here.
are controlling how much fast or or by La the amount by which I move right the magnitude by which.
I move and what are these quantities these are actually the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to.
those parameters right so now how does this collect connect to the smooth and the gentle surfaces what is happening.
then on the smooth surfaces you are moving slowly that means your Delta W is small that's why you're moving.
