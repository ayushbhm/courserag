taking the whole of b0 square whereas here I am taking a small fraction again the whole of B1 square.
but a small fraction here again the whole of B2 square but even again a small fraction of P2 square.
right so now I'm controlling the rate at which V2 is going I'm not allowing it to shoot quickly I'm.
doing this exponentially decaying average foreign formula uh no I think we have not seen this earlier but you can.
see where the formula is coming from uh have you seen we have seen this formula earlier when we have.
been discussing momentum right this kind of a formula so if I just substitute here I have actually substituted the.
value of beta as 0.9 and 1 minus beta is 0.1 but instead if I just kept beta and 1.
minus beta and solve for that I would have got the formula as they said that at timestamp VT my.
uh wheat at time step T my v t is going to be given by this formula and what you.
see at V2 is just a manifestation of this formula applied at time Step 2 with the value of beta.
