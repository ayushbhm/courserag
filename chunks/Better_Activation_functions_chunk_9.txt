very smaller so in these regions starting from here the gradient is very small and that is a problem in.
gradient based learning methods because the updates will not be high right so that's where this discussion is headed ah.
so let's let's try to go there now okay so this is a deep neural network ah and if I.
have used a sigmoid non-linearity then in some point in this chain rule right suppose I am trying to find.
the derivative of this weight with respect to the loss function at some point I am going to encounter this.
in the chain rule I will encounter derivative of H3 with respect to A3 and you can convince yourself right.
I mean any uh any even if W1 or W2 or W3 if I'm trying to find the derivative of.
this with respect to the loss function then this guy is sitting in the path so you will encounter that.
and that is nothing but the sigmoid of the derivative of the sigmoid function with respect to A3 and that.
