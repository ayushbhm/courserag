of this Vector with respect to your parameters which is nothing but taking the gradient with respect to Theta right.
so what would this look like so you have ah two elements in this Vector right so for each element.
you will take a derivative with respect to W you will take a valuator with respect to B for the.
second element also you will take a derivative with respect to W and you'll also take a derivative with respect.
to B so what you will get is dou Square l by dou W square right so you had the.
first partial derivative you are taking the derivative of that again with respect to W so that's what you will.
get now the same partial derivative you will be taking a derivative with respect to B now so you'll have.
dou dou b dou w and similarly you could fill the remaining two entries here right so this would be.
dou b square and this would be dou w dou b right so the way you should remember this is.
