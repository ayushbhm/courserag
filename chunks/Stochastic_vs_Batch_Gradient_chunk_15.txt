some mini batch size let's say the mini batch size is 100 or 200 so if the number of points.
that you have seen so far if it's equal to some mini batch size then you make an update right.
so after every uh batch of say 100 points 200 points only then you make update till that point you.
keep accumulating the uh gradients right so instead of accumulating the gradients for all the points you're accumulating the gradients.
for say 100 points and then making an update right so that's the only difference in the uh code and.
now these stochastic estimates are better because now instead of uh asking instead of flipping the coin once and then.
estimating the probability of heads maybe you are flipping it 25 times or 50 times and then trying to estimate.
the probability offense right so let's see what happens when we have k equal to 25 and we'll compare k.
equal to 25 versus k equal to 1 right so let's see that okay so we are going to run.
