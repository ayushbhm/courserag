of w 1 and W 9 8 so that is the same as MX plus C so I have the.
x axis I have the X and I have the y axis and I have just drawn the line which.
is given by this our equation right and now if I repeat it K times every time I will get.
a different line and I will keep drawing all those K lines right so that's what I am going to.
show you in the animation here so every time a new line let's just see what happens here oops um.
okay so this is okay I'll come back to this animation later let's see yeah so this is what happens.
so this is what I'm going to do now right so this optimization problem I am going to solve for.
the simple model which is y equal to W 1 x 1 plus W naught and I am going to.
do that a k number of times right and every time I solve that optimization problem I get a slightly.
different value of w and W naught and I will keep plotting those lines okay so I am plotting all.
