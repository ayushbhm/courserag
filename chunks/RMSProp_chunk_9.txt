this is happening is because of the exponentially decaying average right so now uh initially if you look at the.
sum so say at time step T the sum was some uh so if you look at the derivative at.
time step 0 right so let's look at the formula if I have it yeah so here remember that this.
is like a moving window right so at time step V1 the weightage of beta 2 was 0.09 at time.
step V2 the weightage of beta 0 was 0.08 so at each time step we see this Behavior where the.
blue curve which is the accumulator curve which is the curve for VT it starts decreasing also because now the.
current sum is less than the previous sum right uh because of the exponential weighting right and now because of.
that what is happening is that in the case of ADA grad because your history was always accumulating your denominator.
was always growing so hence there was always a decay in the learning rate but now since your history can.
