be clear from the diagram and the equation how the zis will be computed so you'll just do this Z1.
Z2 for all the cells right now let's see if we can vectorize all of these computations right that means.
can we compute the Z1 to ZT in one group right so here I first told you how to compute.
Z1 then I told you how to compute Z2 and then similarly Z3 up to ZT right but my whole.
point was that I don't want to compute these outputs sequentially right that's why I didn't like rnns because the.
output of the RN and if this was the RNN block then these outputs were coming one by one and.
at the end of all this I don't want to do the same thing again right I want all of.
these to come out in parallel otherwise it doesn't help me right I might as well have stayed with RNs.
right so now can I do this in parallel so now let's see how I am Computing uh q1 q1.
was The Matrix WQ multiplied by H1 how would I compute Q2 it would be the Matrix WQ multiplied by.
