this here is just my y hat vector and this here is just my one hot vector which in which.
only the lth entry would be one and everything else would be zero just as we had done on the.
previous slide so this is just the difference between two vectors okay and the minus sign has been accommodated for.
appropriately right so i think [Music] yeah okay this minus sign should have been outside right because this was there.
