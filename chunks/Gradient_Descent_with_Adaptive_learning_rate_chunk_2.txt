in notation which I had to do because now we have four inputs so it's not a change in notation.
just a new notation so we have these four inputs so far we have been dealing with a simple neural.
network where we had one input one bias and then the output I'm looking at four inputs X1 X2 X3.
X4 and then the bias which is a constant input of 1 and of course each of these inputs has.
an Associated weight W1 W2 w3w4 right so we have been using the subscript for the training instance so there.
are M training instances X1 to xn which is X is bold which is a vector but now we have.
these superscripts for the different uh inputs within a given training instance right so now you could think of X.
as in X as a vector X1 X2 X3 X4 and this is one input right so let's say this.
is the data about one movie and there would be many such movies so say this is the movie one.
so then we have x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 3 x 1 4. right so that's the.
