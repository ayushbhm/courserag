largely different from each other then I don't know how they'll perform on a test data so let's let's look.
at what I mean by that right so suppose my model has a very high variance so this is one.
training data this was the other training data right and I predicted some f hat of X using this training.
data or estimated some effect of X and now again using this if these two are very different from each.
other right so now let us assume this was the actual training data given to me then this is what.
my model would have been right but now if I get a test instance which belongs here then this model.
will do a bad job on that right because if I had been given this as the training data then.
my F at X would have been quite different which means the current F at X would not have been.
very similar to this F hat X and that means if I had a test instance from here this model.
would perform very bad right whereas if my model has a low variance then irrespective of what training data I.
