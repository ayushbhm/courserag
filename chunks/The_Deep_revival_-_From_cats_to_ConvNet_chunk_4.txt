which came around which is I think around 2008 or 10 when it was first there and then in 2012.
onwards the winner in the image net challenge which is roughly like you have 1000 different classes of Images cats.
dogs airplanes trucks and so on and you have a million uh training points and then you have a test.
set which contains images from this set and you have to classify those images accurately right so in 2012 we.
were able to do this with lxnet with a 16 error rate right so 84 percent sometimes the model was.
correct but then after right so then came zfnet which was again an eight layer network but we were able.
to do 11.2 percent reduce the error till 1.2 percent and then within a few years right which is around.
2016 or 17. it went down to 3.6 percent at which point it became better than humans right so what.
does that mean is that if I show these test images Suppose there are thousand images in the test set.
