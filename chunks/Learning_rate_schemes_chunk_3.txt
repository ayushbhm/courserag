Valley here you're not able to go further down right so suppose we had we initialize the weights to this.
yellow point right this is where you had initialized now you're coming down nicely and you'll get stuck in that.
Valley you'll get stuck somewhere at the right point that I have marked where my mouse is currently and you.
will not be able to go down right because your learning rate is decree amazing exponentially over iterations now uh.
now this since the learning rate has decreased so you're you're going down and you are going on a fast.
loop and in most algorithms the learning rate will start decaying and by the time you reach the valley the.
learning rate would have become very small and now you won't be able to come out of that you'll be.
stuck there right so now what if we allow the learning rate to increase after some iterations right at least.
there's a chance that it might escape the saddle point right and that's what the idea is that you try.
