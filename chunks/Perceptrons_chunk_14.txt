go and watch the movies if any of these inputs is not on right if either the actor is not.
what you're looking for then you'll not go to watch so this is the bias right this is what it.
tells you about that specific user and hence it's called the prior or the bias right but if you are.
like a movie buff who does not care about who the director director director is and in that case your.
threshold could be zero and even if none of these criteria are matched the actor is not matt damon the.
director is not nolan the honor is not thriller still you will cross the threshold and still you will go.
and watch the movie because you are just a movie buff so this threshold is trying to encode the initial.
bias that you have right and it could be adjusted to reflect whether this person is a movie buff or.
not right in other situations it could be reflected to uh it could be adjusted to reflect the prior as.
