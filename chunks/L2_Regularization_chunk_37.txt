decreased much more as compared to W1 right so first observation yes indeed my weights Shrunk the second observation that.
the weights have not shrunk uniformly they have shrunk by certain different factors and that is expected because those factors.
depend on the eigen values so those factors are Lambda 2 Lambda 2 by S Alpha right now the question.
is why did W1 shrink more than W2 right and to understand that you need to look at this loss.
surface here now that if you look at that you should be able to understand why if W2s shrunk more.
then that means W2 is not so important as compared to W1 so if you look at this loss surface.
the solid loss surface does it give you that impression that's the question I'm trying to ask and indeed it.
does right so I'll tell you why so if you look at this direction which is the W2 Direction then.
here you can see that the distance between the contour lines is very smaller as compared to the distance between.
