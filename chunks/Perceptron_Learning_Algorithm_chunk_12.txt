that from linear algebra so the angle is going to be 90 degrees right and because we know that cos.
of the angle is equal to this formula and if w transpose x is 0 so the cos of the.
angle would be 0 and the angle would be 90 degrees right so this is slowly we have now started.
moving into the territory of geometry and linear algebra right so now we know that if the point lies on.
the line then the angle is 90 degree with the weight vector okay now let's uh go ahead right so.
if the point if the vector w right if it's perpendicular to every point on the line then it just.
simply means that it's perpendicular right so if this is the line w transpose x equal to 0 then my.
weight vector is going to be perpendicular to that so nothing great again right now let's see some points which.
lie in the positive half space of this line right so this is my line and i'm going to look.
at the points which lie in the positive half space what is the positive half space it means that w.
