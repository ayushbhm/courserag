y one hat there is no y one hat that shows up here if i try to compute with y.
two hat then it would be minus 1 over y2 hat because that's the derivative of so if you want.
to compute the derivative of log x with respect to x that's 1 over x so the same thing apply.
here instead of x we have y 2 right if i want to compute with any of the other guys.
y 3 hat y 4 add up to y k hat it's going to be 0 right so that's that's.
very straight forward so what does it mean it's like an if else condition right so this is going to.
be equal to minus 1 of 1 over y hat l if i and l tend to be is are.
the same that means the quantity that i am taking the derivative with is also the quantity that is there.
inside the log then it would be minus 1 over y hat l otherwise it would be 0 because then.
there is i'm taking the derivative of one variable with respect to another and they don't depend on each other.
