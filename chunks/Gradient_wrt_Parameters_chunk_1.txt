a generic uh WK that's what I'm interested in and again my recipe is going to be the same instead.
of computing this uh gradient at one go right so this is the derivative of a scalar with respect to.
a matrix so this is again going to be a matrix but instead of computing all the elements the entire.
Matrix at one go I am first going to compute the derivative of one of the elements of this Matrix.
right so what I'm going to do is I just ignore this part for now I'm going to let it.
be I'm going to compute the derivative of the loss function with respect to one element of the Matrix so.
that could be say w k i j right so this Matrix has n cross n or N1 cross N2.
entries so I'm going to focus on Computing the derivative with respect to one of these entries right and now.
let me just link it to the diagram that I have suppose this is the entry that I am looking.
for which in this case tragically happens to be W 2 2 right so it's the yeah it's the weight.
