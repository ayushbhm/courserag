in the second case also it will draw some boundary and here the situation is better as you can see.
it's making an error on some three orange points which are getting classified as blue and maybe a couple of.
blue points which are getting classified as orange right and in most real-world applications we could deal with this kind.
of an error right so there are like maybe uh 10 uh blue points here of its two are wrong.
and 10 orange points of which two or three are wrong so 20 error we could deal with unless this.
is like a mission critical uh application in which case it might be difficult but in most real world applications.
we might be okay with it right for example if you're predicting whether this person is likely to vote for.
one party or the other and if you make some error in that prediction like 20 of the people you.
predict wrongly it won't make much of a difference right so it would still give you some rough idea of.
