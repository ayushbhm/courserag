0.5 and b is equal to minus 1 right this is also bad and how bad is it it's saying.
it's 0.121 right so earlier my loss was 0.09 now my loss is 0.121 right so it's even worse right.
and you can see from the figure also that's even worse right so let me try something else i'll try.
minus 0.1 now okay like some of these values are not here but let's say i try this value right.
again i see that my loss is increasing so then i keep changing right so i keep trying different values.
and then i tried 0.94 and minus 0.94 and i saw that the loss is 0.0214 okay so this is.
good okay this seems to be good so let's let's see what my rational was it it started with 0.50.
i got a loss of 0.07 then i randomly jumped to some other point the value increased okay so then.
i concluded that i made the w negative maybe that's a problem right this is what my thinking was this.
is how i have come up with these numbers so let me interest increase the w so i increased the.
