weighted sum so Alpha 4 J J equal to 1 to capital T into h j right so now I.
am just taking a weighted aggregate of all these representations right and these are the alphas for the time step.
4 and using that I'm going to compute S4 similarly now I should better clear some things here similarly if.
I want to compute S2 I am again going to take an attention weighted sum and these are going to.
be Alpha 2 so there will be Alpha 2 1 Alpha 2 2 all the way up to Alpha 2.
Phi in this case and general Alpha 2T and once I have the alphas I'm going to compute S2 as.
the attention weighted sum so Alpha 2 J h j j equal to 1 to capital T or Phi in.
this case right and these are just to remind you my word embeddings are what I'm calling as the edges.
right so it's just going to take a weight at some of the edges now you already see the advantage.
I already have the edges with me right I just got the entire sequence of words so I just looked.
