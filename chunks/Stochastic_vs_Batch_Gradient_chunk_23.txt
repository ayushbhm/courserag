well as nestrov you see some oscillations as we are going again ahead again because of the stochastic version of.
the algorithms but the relative strengths remain the same right so you can see that the moment of curve which.
is green it takes a longer U-turn as compared to the Maestra one which is blue it quickly comes back.
right and that is the expected behavior of nestra versus momentum right so the relative qualities remain the same in.
addition you see this stochastic related uh oscillations because your estimates are not perfect right so that's the only difference.
that you have and I'll make the same commentary on the next like yeah so while the stochastic versions uh.
retain their relative advantages of Nag over momentum uh there is still this oscillation Behavior which is there and both.
of them converge much faster than the stochastic gradient descent right so after 500 steps you can see that the.
