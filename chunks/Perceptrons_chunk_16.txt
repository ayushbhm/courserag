right now let's move on to a different set of questions so what kind of functions can be implemented using.
the perceptron right we know the answer for the mecolic bits neuron can it can only be used to implement.
boolean functions which are linearly separable that means you can draw a line and all inputs which have a positive.
output will lie on one side and all inputs which have a negative output will lie on the other side.
so is the perceptron any different or what kind of functions can it be used so if you look at.
the mathematical form of these two there is only the red part is different right so earlier you had summation.
x i greater than equal to zero now you have summation w i x i greater than equal to 0..
so in essence both of these are actually finding linear boundaries right just that now you have certain coefficients for.
your inputs right so that's what is happening here it should be clear that even for a mecca for a.
