to compute this right so we'll see how to calculate that but first let us look at a very simple.
deep neural network which is a very thin network but it's a deep network right that means that every layer.
i just have one neuron and i have just one weight which connects my input to that and so on.
right it just keeps computing it's a very simple computation so you can actually write y hat as a function.
of x very easily in this case right now it is easy to find the derivative by the chain rule.
so what is the derivative that are interested in i'm interested in the derivative of the loss function with respect.
to this weight right and this weight is very far away from the loss function right because it's not uh.
very close right i would say this weight is closer to the loss function and the weight that i am.
interested is much farther right but i know how to use the chain rule right so i can compute the.
