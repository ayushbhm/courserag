plots are intersecting right of course the I could have drawn some more uh this Contours will go on right.
and similarly I could have expanded this Contours also so there are many places where these two plots will interact.
intersect right it's not that this is the only uh space a place that they will intersect but this is.
where my final solution came out for this problem this is the W tilde that I ended up with so.
w tilde was the optimum point for L tilde where L tilde was L theta plus Omega Theta right and.
this is L Theta and this is my Omega R Theta okay so that is what is happening here now.
I want you to look at this plot right so I will now now we want to look at this.
plot and try to understand how this relates to the geometry and how this relates to the idea that certain.
weights are actually shrinking what exactly is happening here right I want us to pay attention to all of these.
