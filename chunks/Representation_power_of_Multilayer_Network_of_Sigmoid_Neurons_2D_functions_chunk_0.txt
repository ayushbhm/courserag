[Music] now what would happen if you have more than one input right so now this was all for a.
single input right i just had the x axis and the y axis so x was input and y was.
the output but now i have a situation where i have two inputs right and what is happening here is.
interesting right so this is my uh the orient oops i know intention of doing this so now here again.
this now let me be careful and do it well yeah so this is this orange plane that you see.
that is my x1 x2 plane right and i have points on this plane right which you can see are.
some the blue points and the orange points right and what is this i've just taken my oil mining example.
again and suppose this is the salinity axis and this is the pressure axis right so a blue point here.
is simply the x1 comma x2 point on this planet where the salinity is equal to x1 and the pressure.
is equal to x2 and same the all the points here are just the x1 x2 coordinates where x1 is.
