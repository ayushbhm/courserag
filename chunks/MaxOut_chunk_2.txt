the training example here also it's not being removed so it's not that now you have 999 samples here you.
have the entire thousand samples I took one from there sample randomly one from there created a copy and put.
it in this bucket and I still have thousand here again I send them sample one randomly and put it.
in this bucket and I keep doing this till this bucket has thousand entries right so I'm create I'm sampling.
with replacement and I'm creating multiple such uh sub multiple such training sets from the original training set and each.
of these training sets will then be used to train a model and those models would have their own parameters.
like W1 to WK so here W just think of it as T direct it's a collection of all the.
parameters in the models I'm calling it W uh here all the parameters in the model and here W1 W2.
correspond to the parameters of these K different models each trained on a different version of the training set and.
