here and you have the step function there and that step function is obvious because of the formula that we.
were using which is this Y is equal to one if something Y is equal to 0 if something zero.
then go to one right whereas now you have this smoother formula which we just saw on the previous uh.
slide uh which is just one over one plus exponent of something right and that gives you this smooth function.
right and even if you look at the plots then you see that the uh perceptron function is not smooth.
and hence not differentiable at this sharp change at the value where it changes whereas the uh sigmoid function is.
smooth it is continuous and its differential so now why do we care about continuity why do we care about.
differentiability so for a large part of this course calculus is going to be the hero right so whatever algorithms.
that we study today and going forward in the next few lectures everywhere calculus would play an important role in.
