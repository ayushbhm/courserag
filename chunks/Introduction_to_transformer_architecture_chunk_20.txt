something happen at I minus 1 to be able to compute Alpha TI right you can just compute all of.
that in well right now the other question is so the main takeaway here is that the attention can be.
paralyzed but now the other question that I have is that can you compute this in parallel for all T's.
right so I said that at a particular T you can compute it in parallel right now I'm asking that.
suppose there's this time step 5 also here so can I compute Alpha 4 eyes right all the alpha force.
and all the alpha phi's and all the alpha threes right so all these Alphas across different T's right so.
my T is changing here can I compute them in parallel a given set of values all the Alpha Four.
Stars right Alpha Four one up to Alpha 40 I can compute in parallel that we have already seen but.
can I compute all of these in parallel at one go and the answer is clearly no right the reason.
is that it depends on S T minus y right so unless I have computed St minus 1 I cannot.
