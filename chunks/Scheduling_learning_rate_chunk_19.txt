and you're kind of married to it either learning rate is good then you would progress well if that learning.
rate is too high or too low then either you will keep oscillating if it's too high or if it's.
too low then you will not be making Fast movements right so instead of sticking to one learning rate why.
not try a bunch of learning reads right so that's what we are trying to do here that you're trying.
different learning rates okay now you compute the derivative and your w t plus 1 is equal to WT minus.
ETA times the derivative right now the derivative of course does not change but you can plug in different values.
of ETA you can plug in the value 0.1 you can plug in the value 0.5 plug in the value.
1 to 10 all of these values right and for each of these you will get a new value for.
2 w t plus 1 right so this would be w t plus 1 corresponding to Eta 1 another WT.
plus 1 corresponding to ETA two and so on so now we have found a new value for weight and.
