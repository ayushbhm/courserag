of 2x square is foreign X where is the derivative of x square is 2x right so it does make.
sense that this is more uh steeper slope than the uh slope of the function x square right so the.
takeaway from here is that when you have a flat surfaces the gradient would be slow so the movement would.
be slow when you have steep surfaces the gradient would be large hence the movement or the change in W.
would be large right now what are the repercussions of this so the repercussion of this is what we saw.
in the previous slide that if you start off from a point as we are unfortunately done in the previous.
slide where the surface is largely flat right then your gradients are going to be very very very very very.
very small and you'll be making these tiny tiny updates W and take a long time to move away from.
that flat surface right so imagine like a very flat surface which is quite big right in terms of the.
