what that does is the following right so this is my Delta Theta Vector the black one I am going.
to multiply by a small scalar so essentially the magnitude of the vector will decrease the direction does not change.
so I'm still going to move in that direction but I'm just going to be a bit conservative and take.
a small step right one small step at a time right so that gives me my update rule which is.
if you tell me what is Delta Theta then I'm going to move by a small value in that direction.
right that's that's what my update rule is going to be now the question of course is what is the.
right Delta Theta to use right I was earlier what was my algorithm in the random guess I was just.
coming up with some Delta Theta just moving there oh and then realizing oh the error has decreased so let.
me just go back and then try to find some new Delta Theta change that and I mean change that.
much and then find a new value I don't want to do that someone has to give me the right.
