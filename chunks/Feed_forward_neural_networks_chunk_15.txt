have already computed a 1 1 a 1 2 a 1 3 okay and now i am going to pass.
this vector to a function right a 1 1 a 1 2 a 1 3 okay and now there are.
various functions which can operate on vectors but in this case this is going to be an element wise function.
what does that mean that the output is just going to be g of a 1 1 g of a.
1 2 g of a 1 3 right so i've just put the function inside that means it's just an.
element wise function these are known as element wise functions which operate on vectors that means they operate on every.
element of the vector right now if i choose sigmoid as the function then g of a 1 1 is.
simply going to be 1 over 1 plus e raised to minus a 1 1 right so that's all so.
once i have computed each of these a elements the computation of h is very simple and i'm going to.
compute these each of the edges so i'll get these three dimensional uh h1 right so this is what my.
