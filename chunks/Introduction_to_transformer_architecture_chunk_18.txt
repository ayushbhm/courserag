minus 1. and input I right and then this had this soft Max function to make sure that this uh.
align this Alphas form the distribution rate so they summed up to one right so that's what we have seen.
and you can use any alignment function here uh we had seen one specific function in when we were discussing.
recurrent neural networks so just showing the alignment of function again right and here's a question all right so and.
this is what will lead us to our eventual discussion on Transformers right so can Alpha TI be computed in.
parallel for all I at time step T so what is the question that I'm asking so I'm at a.
particular time step say I'm at time step 4 right so I'm asking can all these Alphas Alpha TI and.
T is equal to 4 so I'm asking whether Alpha 4 1 Alpha four two four three four four four.
five because I can take values from one to five can they be computed in parallel right and the answer.
