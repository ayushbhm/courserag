empirical train error plus a small constant plus some term and now we are seeing that this term is actually.
proportional to model complexity or it is a function of model complexity so I am just going to write it.
as Omega Model complexity right so just to indicate that this is actually dependent on the model complexity so higher.
the model complexity larger this term would be that means your true error would be farther away from the empirical.
trainer so you would estimate the train error and tell me hey it's almost zero but I will not believe.
you because you have not told me anything about this quantity you have only estimated the train error which is.
given by summation I equal to 1 to n y i minus y hat I the whole Square on the.
training data right you have not given me anything about this so even if you tell me that hey your.
training error is 0 I will not believe you because this quantity has not been accounted for and I know.
