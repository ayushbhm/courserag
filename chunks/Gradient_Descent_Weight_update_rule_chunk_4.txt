start going towards this Minima if you initialize it to a point here it will start going towards this Minima.
right so what I've done is I'd initialize it at this point right which was on this side of the.
slope so that's why it went there if I had initialize it here at this value then it would have.
gone into this minimal so just play around with this try different values of w and keep following the formula.
and see whether you are able to reach the Minima I'm sure you will not be easily able to reach.
the Minima and one of the problems there is that ETA is a bit large so it's not helping you.
to control ETA into DW here I wanted the ETA to be small which so that I could have reached.
the Minima instead of Crossing it I've crossed the minimine going in the upper Direction so all of this is.
something that we'll do in detailer and at this point I just want you to kind of break your heads.
