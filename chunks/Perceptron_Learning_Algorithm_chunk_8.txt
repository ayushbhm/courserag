so how does this ensure that that is what is going to happen sorry okay yeah so why would this.
work right that's the question that i'm trying to ask right it's not very clear to me that why should.
this work so to understand this we'll have to look at a bit of linear algebra and a bit of.
geometry right so let's let's go there so we have two vectors w and x and these are what those.
vectors look like w naught up to w n just as i had written on the previous slide and x.
s one up to x one x two x n right and now if i consider the dot product between.
these two vectors then this is exactly what i get and this is what the expression that you are seeing.
on the previous slide i was taking some decisions based on whether this value was greater than z equal to.
0 or less than less than 0 right so this is the quantity that we are dealing with and now.
i'm just telling you which is obvious that this quantity is nothing but the dot product between the weight vector.
