point which should have been in the negative half space is now lying in the positive half space right so.
now my learning algorithm should be such that you should draw the line in a way that my negative points.
are on one side and the positive points or the points which give a negative output are on one side.
and positive output on the other side right so that's what we would want from the perceptron algorithm and this.
uh same thing right where i have put in these uh try to substitute the values and then come up.
with inequalities and then just hand solve for the inequalities the same thing you could have done for the mecolic.
pits neuron there you would have had only w naught right there was no w1 and w2 so you would.
have come up with four sets of inequalities and only one variable which is theta or w naught and then.
you could have tried to find the value of that data so you can go home and try this try.
