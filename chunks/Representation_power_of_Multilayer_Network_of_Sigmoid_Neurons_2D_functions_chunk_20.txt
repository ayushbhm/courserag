check out this network and convince yourself that you can get a 2d function it's the same thing that we.
did for 1d just like one more level of complexity added right and you can see that the number of.
neurons in my middle layer has now increased right this has become four neurons okay and also our initial goal.
was to prove that a single layer neural network should be sufficient i have not proved it for a single.
layer right so what you will have is one layer where the number of neurons will keep growing so it.
will be like a three layer network which can approximate any arbitrary function right now you could take this idea.
further and prove for the one layer case also but as i said that proof will be a bit complicated.
but at least i have shown you that with three layer network you can approximate a 2d function right to.
arbitrary degree of precision right so that's what we have been able to do so now what will happen is.
