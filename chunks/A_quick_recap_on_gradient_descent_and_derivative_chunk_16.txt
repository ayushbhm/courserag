so this is what was happening in our gradient when we when we ran this algorithm right so let me.
just give some uh context here ignore this for now ignore the of yeah so ignore uh this for now.
right just focus on the uh top graph and I'll tell you what we are trying to do there okay.
yeah so I was just trying to run the gradient descent algorithm this was my the the Flying Carpet kind.
of a structure that you see it was what my loss function looked alike and I started with some random.
initial value right which is the black point where I have started this is the loss and these this is.
the point corresponding to W comma B right so my w was somewhere around -5 and my B was also.
somewhere around minus 5 right so that's the point from which I started and as you can see my loss.
is quite high it's around 0.4 or 0.5 something like that okay so now I run the gradient descent algorithm.
so at every step I am going to change my w and B so this point that you see on.
