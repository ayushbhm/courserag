because most real world data is going to be not linearly separable right so here suppose you have two classes.
of people right people who like machine learning and people who don't like machine learning right now it's going to.
be the case that there are some people here maybe the blue guys here right okay which satisfy all the.
characteristics of what the guys who like machine learning satisfy but they still don't like it right and same way.
the other way around also right so you could think of it a more easier example would be that if.
you have a certain locality right and you might assume that all people on that locality speak a particular language.
right but there might be a few people there who don't speak that language or speak another language right and.
so there would always be this outliers right so its data will never be linearly separable right and it need.
not just be outliers you could have other things also now this is a very good example there is no.
