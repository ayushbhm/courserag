what how I went from here to here right and again I have said that this quantity also becomes zero.
so why does that quantity become zero so this is y hat minus y okay so here you are a.
random variable is y hat and this is w i Epsilon I so Y is of course not a random.
variable w i is also not a random variable so what is the random variable y hat and Epsilon I.
right so this is again the product expectation of the product of two random variables and now again y hat.
and Epsilon I are independent because y hat had nothing to do with Epsilon that was the uncorrupted output whereas.
Epsilon is the noise that you have added and the noise that you have added had nothing to do with.
the uncorrupted output so these two are independent random variables so this expectation you can also show that will go.
down to 0 right so then the only thing that you are left with is this and this quantity uh.
so let's see from there where do we go so this becomes the expected value of this error right plus.
