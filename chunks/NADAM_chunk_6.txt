that this yeah so now I have after doing the look ahead I have reached somewhere I have made that.
updates uh and then I've read somewhere and then I have computed my history Vector again this is my history.
Vector that I have computed again and then I've used that to make my final update right and this is.
what my final update looks like it's w 1 minus M1 right because I'm just substituting uh values in this.
equation now let me just use the pen so I'm just substituting values in this equation my ETA is equal.
to 1 and time step is 1 so W1 minus M1 is what I get and now if I substitute.
the value of M1 it turns out to be this quantity right it's beta M naught plus Delta W 1.
minus beta M naught okay so now what is happening here is that if you look at this m naught.
right which is M of T minus 1 it is used twice right first it is being used to make.
this temporary update to the value okay you make that temporary update and then switch back to the original value.
