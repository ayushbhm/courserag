i will get k such deltas okay so this is what the numerator looks like okay now so so far.
we have that w transpose pi is less than equal to zero hence we made the correction right for the.
current point this condition was the unfavorable condition was satisfied hence i had made a correction and cos beta was.
given by this definition of that the numerator is greater than equal to this condition right so the numerator is.
equal to this and then i derived a series of things that the numerator is greater than equal to zero.
okay now i'm going to focus on the denominator okay so the denominator is the norm of w t plus.
1 so the square of the denominator would be the square of the norm okay now again w t plus.
1 the norm i can first i'm going to expand wt plus 1 which is wt plus pi right so.
wt plus pi norm square right that is what this is and the norm is just the dot product of.
the vector with itself right so wt plus uh the square root of the dot product so now this would.
