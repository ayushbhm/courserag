have come up with four sets of inequalities and only one variable which is theta or w naught and then.
you could have tried to find the value of that data so you can go home and try this try.
to write the four inequalities for the mcculloch pits neuron remember there will be no w one w two and.
then just see if you can come up with the right value of theta so that is also doable right.
so this the idea of learning is or finding the right value for the parameters is not something that we.
have come to suddenly i'm just saying that we had already done it in the case of the mp neuron.
also where we had tried to find this value of theta it's just that there it was very obvious what.
the value of theta should be as here it could be a bit difficult right and we'll have a learning.
algorithm to do that so i'll end this module here and when we come back i am going to talk.
about errors and error surface.
