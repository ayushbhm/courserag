wnb and subconsciously I was actually moving on this lost surface without actually knowing what the loss surface was that's.
what I was doing in the uh in the in the guesswork algorithm and Computing this entire loss surface is.
difficult because you have values from minus infinity to Infinity right okay so then uh we said we want a.
more principled way such that I don't need to do Brute Force I don't need to compute all values of.
the loss function for or rather the value of the loss function for all values of w and B nor.
do I want to do this random guessing so that's where we went to gradient descent and the key I.
idea here was to rely on Taylor series right and I'll just skip all this part which was setting up.
the context for the Taylor series right so we all understand what Taylor series is allows us to compute the.
value of a function in a small neighborhood around the current point so if you know the value of the.
