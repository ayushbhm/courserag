now 10 years from now 100 years old now can you apply the same at the galaxy scale and try.
to predict about how the galaxy would look right and now if you can predict that then if you can.
generate that image right then you then scientists can make certain claims about what is going to happen there right.
is that star becoming older or what exactly are some of the physical phenomena that might be linked because of.
which this image is getting generated right so this is again a very different way of doing astronomy which is.
not being thought about or popular a few years back right okay uh similar uh stuff has happened uh for.
uh uh for finding uh fundamental variables right which are hidden in experimental data right so i'll not try to.
explain this i'll just i don't think i have time to play this video also but there's a very interesting.
video here i would recommend that you see the first five minutes of this video to understand uh what this.
