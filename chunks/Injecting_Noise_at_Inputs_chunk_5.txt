that you have these n inputs and to each of these inputs you have added some gaussian noise okay and.
the noise added to each input is independent of the other inputs and then you're trying to predict a y.
okay and the noise is coming from zero mean and some variance so now your X tilde that the corrupted.
X is the original X plus this noise and now your original y hat right without the corruption your this.
is what your y hat should have looked like right there's no surprising here no surprising I have not used.
any non-linearity this is just like a linear transformation right so your model is simply Y is equal to W.
transpose X this is a linear model that you're using here right and so this is what your y hat.
should be but now instead of Y hat you are actually Computing y tilde and why do I say y.
tilde because now you don't have X's you have X tildas right you have the corrupted axis now for the.
