that in many applications our input has a lot of redundancy right so I would have captured weight height and.
BMI all three are not needed from the weight and height I can know the BMI right similarly I would.
have captured several correlated things I would have captured weight and centimeter oh sorry weight in kilograms maybe I would.
have captured weight in pounds also or weight in grams also similarly height in centimeters process data is flowing in.
from multiple channels so I do not know even for example I would have calculated the salary I would have.
salary as one of the inputs and I might also have the income tax as one of the inputs right.
now these two are completely correlated so in that case I did not have both these inputs right so my.
data has lot of redundancy so I am doing some sort of a compression where I am reducing it to.
256 values and then I'm trying to reconstruct the input from these 256 values so if I am able to.
