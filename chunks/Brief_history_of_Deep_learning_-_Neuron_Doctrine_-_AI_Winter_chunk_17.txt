there way back in 1965-68 by by scientist called evac nenco and his group who proposed what is looking like.
a very modern uh deep neural network right so this idea also existed quite bad a lot of these ideas.
have had their generations right they were proposed initially maybe the conditions at that time were not so conducive for.
these ideas maybe they were a bit ahead of their times and then 30 years back again people picked up.
those ideas and then maybe the conditions were right so there's again like a repeating theme in this area but.
around the same time what happened right in 1969 so 1957 when you saw those statements being made about perceptron.
and then the new york times articles and many such similar articles the next 12 to 13 years was what.
i would call as the spring time of ei that was a lot of curiosity around this area a lot.
of government funding available for this right at least in the u.s a lot of the funding was on science.
