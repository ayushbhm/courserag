neuron in the uh output layer right a31 a32 all the way up to A3 K so this quantity I.
have already computed right here 3 is equal to I plus 1 and these are the m so this I.
have already computed right what I didn't know was this right so what is this saying let's see I want.
to compute the derivative of one of these guys okay with respect to one of these guys that's what I.
want to do and I am saying that that derivative is this quantity most of you would get that if.
you don't get it let's try to see how we get it so give me a couple of minutes while.
I write a few things on the slide foreign how I went from here to here right so let's first.
understand how did we compute A3 this is what our formula for A3 was it was the weighted sum of.
the inputs plus the bias Vector right so it was just I took this as the input this red guys.
as the input which is the entire H2 Vector then multiplied them by the weights which was W3 and then.
