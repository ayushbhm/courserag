0. okay so this is the line that I get and I do not of course I have fixed at.
minus one and again you can see the negative and the positive half spaces so I'm again making an error.
of 1 it's a different error this time one of the points which should have been in the negative half.
space which is this point uh is actually in the positive half space now right so again I made an.
error of one now let us try a different value of w one W two so I will take the.
values 10 and minus 10 right so I'll just make this 10 and I'll make this as minus 10 okay.
now this is what is happening right so again uh I'm making an error of 2 because one of the.
red points is in the positive half space and the Green Point is actually in the negative half space right.
so only these two red points uh which are 0 1 and 0 0 have actually been ah are in.
the right place right they are in the negative half space and they should be in the negative half space.
