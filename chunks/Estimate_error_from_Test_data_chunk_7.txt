of quantities of which some quantities I can compute and there is one quantity which I can still not compute.
but we will see how to deal with that ok so now what we will do is now we will.
take a small detour to understand how to empirically estimate an expectation and then return to our derivation let's see.
what I mean by that so suppose we have observed the goals scored in K matches you are watching some.
football uh a lot of football games and you've watched some 100 200 games and you have observed the number.
of goals scored say 100 200 games between if you want the same pair of teams or uh all cities.
one team is constant there right so how many goals on average does say Brazil score or some other team.
scores right I never observed this and now the way you compute the expected value we are interested in what.
is the expected value of Z so our random variable here is z and it can take any value 0.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 maybe as many goals as you can score and you are interested in.
