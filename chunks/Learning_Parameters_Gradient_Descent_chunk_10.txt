the gradient the gradient of the gradient is the Hessian right and here are a few things to note now.
right so if you have a scalar quantity right so if I have a function which is Y is equal.
to x square okay then the derivative would be 2x so if I were to compute this at a particular.
value of x then I'll get a square right so derivative of a scalar with respect to a single variable.
is a scalar but now if you have a vector or if you have a quantity uh x square okay.
all this is x square plus Z square right then I can take the derivative with respect to X and.
I can also take the derivative with respect to Z so then I'll get a vector right so the derivative.
of this would be a vector which will be basically the gradient right so that's that's what uh we are.
uh understanding now and this is where I'm going to draw the line right so my argument for that would.
be that ETA is small so ETA square is going to be even smaller hence I can ignore this ETA.
