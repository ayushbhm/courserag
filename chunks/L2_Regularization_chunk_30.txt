eigen value is large then those weights will not get Scaled let's suppose Lambda 1 was very large then nothing.
no change will happen to this guy similarly if Lambda 2 was very large then nothing would happen to this.
guy because Lambda by Lambda plus Alpha would almost be equal to 1 right now on the other hand if.
yeah if Lambda is very less than Alpha then this quantity almost becomes zero that means whatever elements were there.
if this is what your W star was and say this is the ith element if the corresponding ith eigen.
value was very small then it is almost like this weight will go to zero and this is actually what.
we wanted what the effect that we were hoping for was that some of the weights should shrink because if.
all the weights are large then your L2 regularization term which is W transpose W is going to be high.
and now what we are seeing is that if the eigen values are small right then those weights are going.
