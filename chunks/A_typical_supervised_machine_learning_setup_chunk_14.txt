location i'm considering can you tell me what is the oil that i could mine from there so you want.
to plug in that here and tell the company that this is what the quantity of oil i estimate right.
so you want to do that so what do you do in this case and this is the crux of.
machine learning that you assume some function okay you assume there is a function x parameterized by some parameters w.
or more generically we call it theta also at times so i'll just use theta maybe okay so you assume.
some form and that assumption is up to you right you assume that there is a function f hat which.
relates the inputs to the outputs it has certain parameters and now your job is to learn these parameters from.
the given data okay now let's look at a simple k so suppose you assume that y is equal to.
w x plus b this is a function okay and you have assumed that y depends on x it's capturing.
that and you have some parameters now how would you estimate the values of w and b if i give.
