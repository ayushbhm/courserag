foreign [Music] okay so now let's come to the next station in our journey which is we wanted to compute.
the gradients with respect to the hidden unit so it's again following this outline so we are done with this.
part right and now we want to talk to the hidden units and remember there could be many hidden layers.
right but I want to come up with a generic formula so that irrespective of whether I am in layer.
hidden layer 1 2 3 4 it doesn't matter I should have a similar formula or a similar set of.
computation and I don't want to derive this formula independently for every layer right the output layer of a spatials.
I am okay with deriving a formula for that but I don't want to do it for every hidden layer.
right so that's what we'll focus on okay so let's start so before that right so let's try to see.
what we are where we are headed right so this is our hidden layer okay this is the activation at.
