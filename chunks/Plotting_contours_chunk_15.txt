function will change right and now I have entered the value I'm close to convergence and slowly slowly moving so.
that these two points become completely on the sigmoid curve they are not completely on the curve yet slightly off.
but it will slowly move towards that conversion okay so now we know how to see a 3D plot and.
imagine what its contour map would look like or the other way around that look at a contour map and.
understand what the 3D plot could have looked like right because we know that these were the regions of gentle.
slope the and the lost levels are marked I have not marked the actual levels but I've just color coded.
them so wherever you see dark red you know it's bad and whenever you see dark blue you know it's.
good okay fine so we'll end this module here so we know about Contours now and now we'll uh try.
to go back to our discussion on gradient descent and see whether we can fix the problem that we had.
discussed okay.
