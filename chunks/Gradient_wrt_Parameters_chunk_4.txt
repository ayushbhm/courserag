cross so Suppose there are only two neurons here or maybe let's take all the three neurons okay right and.
now this so this is the AK Vector I'm going to just ignore B K I'm just going to write.
it at the end somewhere now this is my w Matrix so this is w k 1 1 uh this.
is going to be w k 1 3 uh this is w k 2 1 I'm just going to write.
the second row completely w k 2 3 okay and this multiplied by h k minus 1 which is just.
going to be h uh K minus 1 in this case uh so I had taken certain values okay let.
me just write it as K in this case was 2 right K was equal to 2 uh so my.
h k minus 1 is going to be H 1 1 H 1 2 H 1 3 right and plus.
I have the B Vector which is going to be I I'll ignore the B Vector right because you'll see.
that it does not show up in the formula right now this a K2 how do I get a K2.
I get it by multiplying this by this right so if I open that up it's going to be w.
k 2 1 into h11 plus w k 2 2 into H 1 2 plus w k 2 3 into.
