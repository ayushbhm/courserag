early stopping Ensemble methods drop out right so quite a bit of a long list and we will maybe look.
at this formula in detail at least in the context of L2 regularization right so let's start there so in.
L2 regularization this is what we do right so we Define our the loss that we want to minimize or.
the effective loss that we want to minimize we Define it as a sum of the training loss which is.
this so which is again I will just write it down once more this is again summation I equal to.
1 to m or rather average oops M of whatever your training losses and we have been dealing with a.
squared error loss right so in the LT case of L2 regularization instead of just minimizing this you also try.
to minimize this right that means you are trying to minimize the L2 Norm of your weight say that's what.
this quantity is and this is some multiplying factor which decide how much weightage should be given to uh this.
