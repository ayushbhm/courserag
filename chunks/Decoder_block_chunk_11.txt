why this is called masked self attention is I'll I'll make these Alphas zero right so whatever Alpha is greater.
than the current decoded word I will make those zero right so Alpha 2 to Alpha capital T will become.
0 so these V's will not participate in the computation so S1 would only depend on the representation of go.
right and in the first case it makes sense right but now as you go deeper at the first case.
you might think this is just trivial right but now as you go deeper let's understand what will happen right.
so now suppose you have decoded this much right you have go none and Transformer right so you have these.
three inputs available to you now you are Computing a represent refined representation Z1 Z2 Z3 all the way up.
to Z T one right now what will you do when you're Computing Z1 your formula was Alpha into v.
j j is equal to 1 to Capital T1 but now since you have decoded up till time step 3.
