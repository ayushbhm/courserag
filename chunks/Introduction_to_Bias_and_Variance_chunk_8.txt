would have just assumed something so in both cases we are making an approximation ah now ah the training data.
that is given to me it contains some 500 points right so I have been given some 500 x comma.
y pairs which I have been given some 500 of these X comma y Pairs and using these I have.
my job is to learn W1 W naught or these 26 parameters depending on which model I am going to.
choose right so that's the setup so now we are going to uh sample sum actually not 500 I think.
it should have been 100 points or here so I was maybe given okay let's assume a bit differently let's.
assume that I was given some 500 points and I'm going to sample randomly pick up some 400 or 300.
points from this and train a simple and a complex Point model I am going to repeat this process K.
times what does that mean that this is what I mean by that right so in this model let us.
try to understand what my full procedure looks like right so I have my loss as I equal to 1.
