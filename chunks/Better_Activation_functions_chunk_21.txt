optimal value of w right this is where you want to go and suppose this is where you had initialized.
your uh weight right so now I would want to have a possible movement like this right and reach the.
optimum but this movement is not possible because it has one value positive one value negative and we know that.
that is not possible we already saw that all these kind of movements are not possible right so this is.
not going to be possible so now how will I have to reach the optimum I'll have to just take.
the movements which are allowed so I will have to perhaps take this movement this is uh okay this is.
the node yeah this is allowed right so this is where like 1 is 0 and the other is uh.
negative so that is allowed this this and so on right so I'll have to move like this in a.
zigzag pattern to kind of reach the optimum right so I'll take more steps to converge and and keeping this.
toy example aside right the simple thing is this right so I'm asking you to go from place a to.
