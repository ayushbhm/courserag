what I'm going to do is my change is going to be just given as Theta Nu is equal to.
wherever I am currently I'll move by this change right so Theta Nu is equal to theta plus Delta Theta.
okay so what is happening here is that I was here and I mean sorry this this is where I.
was and I then added this vector and what has happened effectively that I moved in the direction of Delta.
Theta right I've come closer to Delta Theta and we know this from the perceptron Rolling algorithm also when we.
add it it comes closer to it right so now instead of uh moving fully so let me just delete.
this right so instead of moving fully uh in the direction of Delta Theta what I'm going to do is.
I'm going to be a bit conservative and whatever change you tell me to do I'm not going to do.
that full change I'm just going to multiply that change by a very small value which is ETA so essentially.
what that does is the following right so this is my Delta Theta Vector the black one I am going.
