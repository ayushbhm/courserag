because you are not making a true estimate of the gradient you're just making like a approximation or a stochastic.
update here well and at this point right where it was say oscillating right at the points where you see.
an oscillation let me just use the mouse right so this is one point where you see an oscillation and.
what is happening there is that you approximated the gradient by one point and that point was actually very far.
off as compared to what the true gradient would have been and hence it led to a bad update and.
now again you come back slowly and then you go back towards the minimal right so that's why you see.
these oscillations now uh this is when you use k equal to 1 right but uh and we understand why.
we see many oscillations because we are making greedy decisions and what is happening is here that each point is.
trying to push the parameter so I have a million data points right and I look at one of the.
