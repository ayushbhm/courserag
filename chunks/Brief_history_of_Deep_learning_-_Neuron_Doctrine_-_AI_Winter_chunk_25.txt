it immediately propagates so you might not be aware that someone else has discovered it and independently discovered this algorithm.
that's what was happening at that time and around uh 1986 uh rumel heart and others that including jeffrey hinton.
uh popularized in the this in the context of neural networks and they showed that this back propaganda propagation algorithm.
can be used for training uh neural neural networks and this was an important breakthrough because even to this day.
uh most modern deep neural networks are trained using the back propagation algorithm right there was another important and uh.
an interesting fact is this back propagation uh within it right or at the heart of it there's also gradient.
descent right which was much older right like almost one century one and a half century before back propagation and.
this was discovered or proposed by koshi and for a very different purpose right and he was trying to use.
