case you would be making an error on three points or all the Four Points lie in the negative half.
space that's the worst case scenario right in which case you will be making an error on three points right.
because one one of the two things would be right right I mean it would either be the positive point.
would be correct or the negative points will be correct so that's why it can be only maximum three you.
cannot make an error on all the Four Points um okay so now what I've done here actually is just.
uh plotted the error for all possible values of w one W two and now from the plot I can.
see which are the values which are useful right and I can just pick any of those W and W2.
values which correspond to that dark blue region of the plot right ah so this is what we have done.
but this is okay visually to do but ideally we would want an algorithm such that I don't now I.
can plot this visually for two inputs right but if I had n inputs I can't even plot and visualize.
