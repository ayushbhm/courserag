all of that and then again doing the same in the next iteration so the derivative only gets computed once.
because that does not change but you just use different learning rates to come up with different updated values and.
then select the best updated value based on the loss right so that's what you do in line search you.
have a bunch of learning rates and you don't get married to one learning rate but just try all of.
them at every stage of course there's a complexity here involved here that you are trying 10 different learning rates.
then at every step you're kind of computing 10 values so you have to do 10 times uh the work.
and just in that update equation and then compute the loss again and then select the best one right so.
that's an additional complexity that you have but as you can imagine this would definitely be good right so in.
the flat surfaces you might end up choosing the larger learning rates and in the valley regions where already the.
