us about the slope in that direction if the distance is large then the slope was gentle and I gave.
you explain it with the help of this example I have this slope was steep then the distance was small.
as we saw here right so that's what the contour maps capture so in short they capture all the information.
that we are interested in when we are talking about gradient descent based algorithms right so let me just look.
at one more example right let me take a different function now suppose I take this function okay this is.
what this function looks like right now let me try to guess what the contour map would look like right.
uh or other let me just draw the contour map right this is what the contour map looks like and.
here again you can see that here yeah here the distance is large and does it correspond to my intuition.
that the slope would be large in that region so let's see that right indeed the slope was sorry the.
