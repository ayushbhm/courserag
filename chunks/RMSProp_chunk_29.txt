behavior does not change the orange curve is for the ETA node of 0.6 which we just discussed in detail.
and the black curve is for the ETA naught of point Y right and now what is happening is that.
because my initial learning rate is small this behavior of how quickly it changes with steep slopes and gentle slopes.
is also changing right now you can see that initially this was decreasing rapidly right but now this is not.
decreasing rapidly it's decreasing slowly but it's still always lower than the lowest point that I had reached here right.
so what does that mean that it is still going to be lower than the lowest point that I have.
reached and then again in the Steep regions when it starts increasing it does not increase that rapidly right because.
it's still the numerator is still small so it nowhere grows as much as I wanted here right hence in.
this case you are seeing very wild oscillations in this case you are seeing mylar oscillations and if I also.
