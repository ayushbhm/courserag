already computed right so I am ready to compute derivative of H2 so this part is done I have now.
been able to compute this then I wanted to compute the derivative of a 2 with respect to the loss.
function and the formula on the next slide I'll just go to the next slide now the formula on the.
next slide say is that the derivative of loss function with respect to A2 just depends on H2 and some.
quantity right which is easy to compute right this G Prime is easy to compute and we'll compute it at.
the end right for now just convince yourself because it's a simple function it suppose my uh my my activation.
function was the sigmoid function then I have 1 over 1 plus e raised to minus a 2 2 right.
H22 is equal to 1 over e raised to 1 over 1 plus e raised to minus a22 and if.
I want to compute the derivative of H22 with respect to a22 I can do that right I can apply.
the UV Rule and keep going and I'll be able to get it right so this quantity is easy to.
