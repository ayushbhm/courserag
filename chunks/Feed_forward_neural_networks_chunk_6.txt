n minus one hidden layers and one output layer right now each neuron in the hidden layer and the output.
layer i'm going to split it into two parts right so what are these two parts uh i'll let the.
annotations be for now so there's going to be a part called the pre-activation so the bottom part which is.
the white part that you see i'm going to refer it to as pre-activation and the shaded part is the.
activation right so this is how you refer to it in neural network terminology so you have the input x.
then you have a1 the bunch of outputs that you are producing the first hidden layer a2 the outputs that.
you are producing in the second hidden layer and a3 these are all the pre-activations that you have in these.
layers right now maybe i'll get rid of the activations and then you have the activation which is the shaded.
part h1 h2 and then for the last layer it could be h3 or hl i could also call it.
