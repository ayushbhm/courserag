the inputs plus the bias Vector right so it was just I took this as the input this red guys.
as the input which is the entire H2 Vector then multiplied them by the weights which was W3 and then.
added the biases which was B3 right so that's what this formula is capture now I've just expanded that formula.
I have taken the case where I have only two units two neurons in the output layer that's why I.
have only a31 and a32 and I have three neurons in the previous hidden layer that's why I have it's.
2 1 h 2 2 h 2 3 so this weight Matrix would then be or 2 cross 3 Matrix.
multiplied by a three cross one vector and the bias is I would have just two biases corresponding to the.
two output neurons so I have this two biases right so that's how this computation is now let's write down.
one of of these guys right so a 3 1 is what is that equal to w three one one.
I'm just going to do the multiplication into H to 1 plus W 3 1 2 into h 2 2.
