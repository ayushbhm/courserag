is ETA ETA naught divided by square root of VT plus Epsilon and of course this ETA naught remains constant.
throughout right that's what you have said and only the denominator is change right so now if I change if.
I use different values for ETA naught what happens I already showed you that if I choose if I had.
chosen some favorable value for uh ETA naught then my algorithm would have conversation so I'm just going to show.
you a few more examples along that direction okay so I'll consider two values ETA not equal to 0.6 and.
0.1 and let's see what happens to the to uh example right so first let me run 0.6 and here.
you can see that there's a wide oscillation right so this is almost like a case where uh the following.
is happening right it's oscillating from a high loss region to another high loss region and is oscillating between these.
two points as opposed to a slightly better loss oscillation where it's perhaps oscillating between two low loss regions right.
