that we study today and going forward in the next few lectures everywhere calculus would play an important role in.
particular derivatives would play an important role and hence it's important that the functions that we deal with are differentiable.
right so that's where I leave it for now I'll not delve further into it and you'll get to know.
why differentiability is important because I'll soon start taking derivatives of something right and if I'm taking derivatives of something.
in everything in the calculation is not differentiable of all the functions in world are not differentiable then you can't.
take the derivatives right so that's why it's important to have differentiable functions and that's why we have it's good.
to have the sigmoid Neutron okay.
