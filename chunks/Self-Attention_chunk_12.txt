right so now can I do this in parallel so now let's see how I am Computing uh q1 q1.
was The Matrix WQ multiplied by H1 how would I compute Q2 it would be the Matrix WQ multiplied by.
H2 and that would give me uh Q2 how would I compute Q3 it would be the Matrix WQ multiplied.
by H3 which would give me Q3 all the way up to h capital T so it would be WQ.
multiplied by h t which would then give me Q capital T right so now I can just write this.
as a matrix operation you can just put all of these vectors inside a matrix and if you multiply this.
matrix by this Matrix then you get this Matrix as an output right so all the cues you can compute.
at one go right you don't need to do that sequentially all the query vectors can be computed at one.
go by just multiplying these two matrices WQ multiplied by The Matrix containing all these inputs as columns and then.
you get the queues at one go similarly now what is the dimension of Q right so let's let's look.
