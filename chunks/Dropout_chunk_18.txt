decide whether to keep it or not you just create this random vector by saying that I want 20 of.
the units to be off and then at this layer whatever output you have computed you just multiply it by.
this mask so 20 of the outputs will be set to zero that's the same as this node not participating.
in the computation at all right now when you're masking it what is it that you are effectively doing right.
so what happens is it prevents the nodes from co-adapting right so what does co-adapting mean that if you have.
all the nodes active right then there could be this one lazy guy who says that okay I mean this.
other guy suppose I'm trying to detect faces and this other guy is going to detect noses a nose and.
someone is going to detect eyes and I don't need to do anything then right I can slack I can.
I did not actually work much the other guys can do the work right so that's what co-adapting means right.
