right so it from after every Epoch you're lost when you're checking the loss it's decreasing right and suppose you.
are here now and you so say this was Epoch six and now you ran the seventh Epoch okay and.
you calculate the loss again and it was actually increased right so what will you do now you you had.
you are of course saving the weights after every Epoch so you will throw away all the updates that you.
have done in the last Epoch re-initialize the weights from what they were in the sixth epoch half the learning.
rate and then run the cpoc again right and then hopefully the loss would decrease it's still possible that the.
loss still increases that means your learning rate is still high so again throw away all the updates go back.
to the value of the weights that was there at the end of sixth Epoch half the learning rate again.
and then continue from there right so this is like more data driven learning rate that okay my validation loss.
