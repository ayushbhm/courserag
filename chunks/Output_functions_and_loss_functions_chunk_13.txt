right point two point three point four point one right and somehow you want to be able to capture the.
difference between these two values right so there are two problems that we need to solve here one is given.
that i know that i'm trying to predict a probability distribution because my true output is a probability distribution right.
the sum of the values is one right uh how do i make sure that my output is also a.
probability distribution right that means all the values are between zero to one and they sum up to one right.
so how do i choose an output function such that my output is also a probability distribution if i'm able.
to do that how do i come up with a loss function right such that it tells me the difference.
between these two now one loss function that you can always choose is the squared error loss function right you.
can again treat these as just two vectors and try to find the difference between them but given that you.
