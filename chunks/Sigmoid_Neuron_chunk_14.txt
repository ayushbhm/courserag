threshold or the examples that I have given it's the nature of the function itself right and I'll tell you.
what I mean by that so this is what the perceptron function looks like so uh what I have here.
this is my z-axis okay so on this axis I have Z where Z is the weighted sum of the.
inputs okay so this quantity I'm calling Z which you have seen is the weighted sum of the inputs okay.
and this is my threshold and I know that when Z crosses the threshold my output is going to be.
1 and when Z is less than the threshold my output is going to be 0. so there is going.
to be this sharp increase at 0.5 and that's what was happening in our example still 0.49 I was not.
so upbeat about the movie the moment it cost 0.5 I said okay like this movie right so this is.
the nature of the function itself where if you take this weighted sum and it crosses a threshold you say.
one if not you say zeros this if else nature is what is bringing this discreetness right we're just saying.
