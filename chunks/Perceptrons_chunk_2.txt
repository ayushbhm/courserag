decision and there is no notion of importance all the things like is it training am i in the mood.
is the movie is good all of these inputs were some of given equal weights right and if you go.
back to the biological neuron again there was this connection there and that connection is actually the weight or the.
strength of the connection between two neurons so there also it was of all the neurons giving an input to.
one neuron maybe some had more importance than the others right so that notion of weight or importance is not.
being captured and the last is i ended the previous video saying that could there be not non-linearly separable boolean.
functions and we'll try to address that what what are these functions and are what do you do if they're.
not linearly separable right so not maybe in this particular module or video but these are the questions that we'll.
try to answer over the course of this lecture so so you had this mp neuron or the mecolic bits.
