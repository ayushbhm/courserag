really good comes from the validation data or the test data and not from the training data right you want.
the test error to be small that means the error on unknown points to be small driving the error to.
zero on the known points is easy you can just keep increasing the model complexity and it will go to.
zero right but what you want is to keep track of that sweet spot and to keep track of that.
sweet spot you need the test error because the moment the test error increases you need to stop you see.
I don't want more complexity than this because my test error is increasing right now whatever intuition we have developed.
so far we will try to convert this into a mathematical formulation and then we will try to make a.
case for regularization okay so I'll end this video here.
