statement that I am going to make is that this y minus f of x is actually independent of f.
hat x minus f of x why am I saying that because when I am talking about the Y's here.
I am talking about the Y's coming from the training data because this expectation we are Computing from the training.
data right oh sorry ah test data right so this expectation we are Computing from the test data whereas F.
hat of X was estimated from the training data your test points did not participate in the X in the.
estimation of f hat of X and these y's are actually corresponding to the test data right hence these two.
random variables are actually independent because why the Y's that you are seeing here did not participate in F hat.
of X that they did not have any say in the estimation estimated parameters of f hat X because this.
belongs to test data and the test data did not participate in the estimation of f hat X right so.
