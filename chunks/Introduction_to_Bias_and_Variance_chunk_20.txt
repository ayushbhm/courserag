if I plug in x equal to 0 I compute ah sorry there were 30 models not 25 right so.
I compute ah F hat of x from all the 30 models and then take the average and plot it.
similarly I plug in the value as 0.1 pass it through all the 30 value or 30 models I substitute.
x equal to 0.1 I get 30 different y's I take the average of that and I plot it right.
so what I am plotting here is the average value of f hat X of the simple for the 30.
simple models similarly the blue curve is the average value of f hat X for the complex model right so.
ah this is the what what I am trying to do here is the average value and you know that.
the average I can also call it as the expected value right so the mean is the same as the.
expected value so that is what I am drawing here empirically right I'm just trying to draw the expected value.
for the green curve as well as the for the simple model which is the green line and for the.
