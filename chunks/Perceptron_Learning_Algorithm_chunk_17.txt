decrease from where it is currently because right now i am in a bad situation and that's what i should.
do so let's see if what happens if we do this update so this is the update that we do.
our goal was to want it to be less than 90 degrees we somehow ignored that goal and went ahead.
and said okay let me do this so what i need to convince you is that whether this is in.
line with my goal right so if my new w is w plus x so let me now check what.
my new angle would be right my new angle would be proportional to this right now let me just substitute.
the value of w new it's w plus x okay let me just open up the bracket w transpose x.
plus x transpose x w transpose x is cos alpha right so cos alpha nu is actually greater than cos.
alpha that means alpha nu would be less than alpha that's what i wanted whatever was my current alpha i.
wanted my new alpha to be less than that eventually i want to get it to less than 90 degrees.
