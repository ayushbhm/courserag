as from cats to convolutional neural networks so let's see if I use that title so again going back 1959.
right uh uh Hubble and uh weasel did this experiment right what the experiment did was they had a cat.
which had different electrodes connected to different parts of its brain and now there's a screen in front of it.
where you see that stick there right so just imagine some stick pattern appearing on different portions of the image.
maybe on the top right corner top left corner Center maybe in the center on the left right and so.
on right and what they observed is depending on where the stick is different parts of the brain of the.
cat were getting activated that means the cat has certain receptive field and only if things get triggered and those.
receptive field to certain sections fire if drinks get triggered in a triggered in a different receptor field that means.
the stick is in a different position say the top right corner instead of the top left corner then a.
