at what point it will start going from 0 to 1 right so that's what the B controls okay and.
now I want to do um I've defined h21 as h11 minus h12 right that's how I've defined it so.
let me just do this here so I'll show you h21 oops uh maybe not this way yeah okay so.
now let me just hide the other ones I'll reset everything and just show you HD one so this is.
