does that mean is that if I show these test images Suppose there are thousand images in the test set.
even a human makes error on four or five percent of them right because some of those images may not.
be clear you may not the face of the dog may not be very clearly visible so you may not.
know be able to distinguish between two subclasses within the doc class right two different breeds of toxin and so.
similar errors whereas the model was now able to do it at 3.6 percent and you can see that the.
number of layers has also increased significantly starting with 8 in LX net going all the way up to 152.
uh in the resnet model right and this is when it was I mean almost uh clear or universally accepted.
that now deep learning has arrived and for all image problems we have to migrate to uh what are known.
as convolutional neural networks or the Deep learning way of doing things right and similar uh inroads also started happening.
