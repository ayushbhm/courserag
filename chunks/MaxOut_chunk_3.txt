correspond to the parameters of these K different models each trained on a different version of the training set and.
each training set has the same size but it contains uh sampling with replacement right so what would happen in.
that case is that it is shown that if you do this sampling with replacement right so this bucket that.
you had the first bucket that you created that was used to train the model f hat1x which had a.
collection of parameters W1 so that bucket around 46 percent of the samples there would be duplicated and does make.
sense right because you're sampling with replacement so all roughly half the samples would get duplicated in this set so.
it won't be that all these thousand would be unique that should be obvious and there's also some analysis that.
roughly half of the samples are actually duplicates so we always expected duplicates there's a study which says exactly how.
