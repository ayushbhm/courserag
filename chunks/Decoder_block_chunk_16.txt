coming out from the encoder you'll again pass them through your standard QE uh key and value matrices right and.
then you will have to words within the decoder or the representations coming from the decoder as the query right.
so whatever has been decoded so far that will become the query and then you will pass it through this.
normal attention Network right so now what happens is the following that let's understand this conceptually so This S1 to.
St so far right I should call it S1 to S small Edge right that is the number of words.
that have indicated so far those have been uh refined representations of your original words by looking at the context.
also right the context came in through that summation Alpha V right so these are refined representations already but taking.
care only of self attention that means within the decoder now you want to refine these representations further in the.
light of whatever you had seen in the encoder right so now you want to take S1 as the input.
