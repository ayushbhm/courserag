model which was later refined and analyzed by minsky and pappered again we had referred to this in the history.
in 1969 so that's the model that we're going to uh be talking about is just to make it clear.
that what we are talking about okay so let's go ahead right so what does the uh perceptron model look.
like so it's it's very similar right in form at least so you have y is equal to one if.
the weighted sum of the inputs is going to be greater than equal to threshold right so earlier oops in.
the uh mcculloch pits neuron or the mp neuron there was no notion of weights so it was just that.
if the sum of the inputs is greater than equal to threshold but now i have if the weighted sum.
of the inputs is greater than equal to threshold and that's where i get to assign weights to input so.
if the input value is small but the weight to the input is large then still the contribution would be.
higher right and notice that this index is over 1 to n because there are n inputs so from the.
