H2 dependent on H1 so hence you had all seen all the information up to or rather HD dependent on.
HT minus one so when you are Computing HT you had information of all the T minus one Birds before.
it that's where the contextual representation was coming out but at each step what you are doing is this right.
so you are Computing a new representation for that word which was a context of a representation here looks like.
more computations are happening but at the output you just have these Z1 Z2 Z5 so again you could think.
of it as you have the excise as input and you are producing these zis as an output and these.
z-is are again some kind of a contextual representation of the input that you have given that means zis are.
not only aware of X I's they are also aware of all the other words in the uh sentence right.
so that's that's what is happening here so the similarity is that RNN takes X1 to x y and gives.
