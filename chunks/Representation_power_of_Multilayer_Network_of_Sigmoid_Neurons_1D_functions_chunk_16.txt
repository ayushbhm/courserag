right and all of these are similar except for their position on the x-axis and for their Heights or lengths.
as you may see right okay so this is what we have come to so now if I take an.
input and if I know I have been given an input X if I know if I have a magical.
box called the tower maker okay so I will make a tower I have as many such boxes as I.
want right which I'm making these towers okay and then I passed all of these towers so some there's a.
tower maker right it is taking an input okay and it's just making a tower all of these boxes are.
identical in what they do the only difference is the amplitude or the height and the position right but otherwise.
they are all Tower makers if I get all these Tower makers and if I add them up then I.
can construct my original function plan right that's the idea so what I'm looking for now is this fundamental unit.
called the tower maker if I have that then I have given you a network which can approximate from given.
