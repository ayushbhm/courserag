done one Epoch calculate what the validation loss is and let's say the value is some X okay now with.
the same learning rate run the second Epoch right so now you are you have already computed some values of.
the weights you have made a lot of updates after one Epoch and you have some value of w just.
start from there run the second Epoch and keep the same learning rate and at the end of this Epoch.
again look at the validation error so the validation error is also decrease that means things are going fine right.
your training error is definitely decreasing and your validation error is also decreasing so maybe this learning rate is not.
so high you can continue with it but if the validation loss starts increasing right then what would you do.
in that case uh let me just illustrate this what I mean right so this is a good validation loss.
right so it from after every Epoch you're lost when you're checking the loss it's decreasing right and suppose you.
