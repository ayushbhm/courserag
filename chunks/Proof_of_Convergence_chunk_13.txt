delta is the minimum value so all these values are going to be greater than equal to delta so that's.
how i'm going to define delta so now with that definition i can say that this quantity here is going.
to be greater than equal to this quantity this directly follows for my argument that all of these quantities are.
going to be greater than equal to delta so irrespective of which of these pi's i have picked up p1.
to pm the wstar.pi is going to be greater than equal to delta hence this sum here is going to.
be greater than equal to the sum here right follows simply from the definition right where delta is the minimum.
dot product between w star and all the points that i have okay is this definition clear okay so now.
let's proceed so now i can again for w t again replace it by the definition right so wt was.
again wt minus 1 plus some pj so at the previous time step i would have taken some pj right.
and wt minus 1 i would have adjusted by adding some pj so pj is again one of these p.
