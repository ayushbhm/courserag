right so now what I have done here is this quantity has disappeared and this U I have written as.
W minus W star so wherever I see do I have substituted as W minus W star nothing great again.
about that and this Delta WL this quantity has disappeared so I'm just left with the first term and this.
last term here okay that's what my LW looks like where LW uh yeah it's the unregularized loss now let's.
just look at a few other quantities yeah so now uh this is the uh if I compute the derivative.
of this right so this is what my LW was now if I compute the derivative of this that's the.
same as the derivative on the uh of the quantity on the left hand side so I can take the.
derivative of this quantity and I can just open up the brackets I have derivative of L W Star Plus.
H into W minus W Star right so this again you can think of this as uh uh x h.
x right so you are kind of taking the derivative of a quantity which has x square right and the.
