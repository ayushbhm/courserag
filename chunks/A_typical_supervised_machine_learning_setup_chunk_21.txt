this equation right so to look at the points and then come up with this equation right then you have.
to find the values of w and b so that's the same idea here that's why you need these parameters.
okay now learning algorithm right so once you have set up the model you have the data now you need.
an algorithm so that you can learn these parameters template in the case of y is equal to mx plus.
c our algorithm was simple just have two points plug them in get two simultaneous equations solve that right so.
the algorithm is the algorithm for solving the simultaneous equation and we are done right but in large parameters large.
data we need something better something more principled and we have already seen one example which is the perceptron learning.
algorithm and now we are going to see gradient descent in some time right so that's what we need now.
what should the goal of this learning algorithm be so when would you say that the parameters that i have.
