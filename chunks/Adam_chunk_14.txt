now let's look at okay now let's take the expectation on both sides that I have empty on one side.
and I have uh the Delta WT quantity on the other side so I'm going to take expectation on both.
sides so expectation of m t is equal to the expected value of this expression now I'll just take the.
constants out and move the expectation inside so the expectation so 1 minus beta here will come out because it's.
a constant then I have the expectation of a sum which is the same as the sum of an expectation.
okay foreign and now again the beta term will come out and the expectation goes inside and now what I'm.
going to assume is that all the WTS they come from the same distribution right because I have what does.
that mean right so what does the distribution mean in this case so you could think of hey the gradient.
itself could have different values right and that those values could come from some distribution right so these are your.
