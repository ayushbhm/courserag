weighted average of current and all pass gradients right as I was saying that if you are currently at time.
step 9 right then the weightage for the current gradient would be one right because this would be 9 minus.
9 and that would be 0 if you are at time step if you are looking at the gradient at.
time step 8 then that would be 9 minus 8 so it would be given the weightage of beta and.
as I said beta is typically 0.9 so this would keep decreasing exponentially so gradients which were taken very long.
back will have very less say in this cumulative history right so that's what the idea behind momentum is and.
now with this idea in mind let me go back to the previous slide I'll again try to look at.
the equations right so this is what the equations look like now we understand that this quantity here actually captures.
the entire history okay the weights are initialized randomly your U minus 1 is 0 and beta is a constant.
