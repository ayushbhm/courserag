uh makes deep learning so attractor right so what is it saying right we are take any complex reliable function.
that you have let's return back to our oil mining example where f of x was very complex we did.
not even know what f is and we know that it's a very complex function based on your input variables.
such as salinity pressure temperature Marine diversity and all that it's very hard to know what that function is but.
now I can come up with a neural network which when takes an input its output would be very close.
to the desired function right in theory I can do that of course the Practical difficulty is that this such.
a neural network would have a hidden layer with a very large number of neurons and if it becomes exponential.
then we know it's not practical right but at least theoretically I can do that and this is only talking.
about a single hidden layer right and one of the things that maybe you will see through an assignment or.
