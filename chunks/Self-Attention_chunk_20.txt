exactly the computation which is happening here right so that's why this entire thing can be produced as a matrix.
matrix multiplication and all of this can be done in parallel so just to recap your V's can be computed.
in parallel your case can be computed in parallel your cues can be computed in parallel once you have that.
you get all the Z's in parallel at one shot right so that's what is happening here which are able.
to compute they are able to paralyze the entire computation of your Z and what actually is z just in.
case you have forgotten so you have the input as H1 H2 all the way up to h t and.
Z was the output of this network right and my main goal was that this output should be computed in.
parallel as computed as compared to rnns where I was getting 1 then 2 then 3 and then four right.
but now I have shown you that all of this can be done in parallel and you just need to.
