and hence unlike the other algorithms you're proportionately moving in the direction of w Oz right of course here still.
the momentum wage algorithm was faster because momentum of course has its Advantage right it makes mistakes but it still.
reaches the Minima faster so let me just play that again you can see that the momentum based algorithms both.
nestrum and all this reached faster right but compared to gradient descent adagrad was able to move faster right and.
there is still scope to improve Ada guide because it does not have a momentum term if I had added.
a momentum term term then I could combine the advantages of momentum as well as this adaptive learning rate and.
we'll probably get in that direction at some point right we'll get in that direction meaning we'll get towards such.
an algorithm at some point right but for now you see the advantage that I'm able to move uh proportionately.
