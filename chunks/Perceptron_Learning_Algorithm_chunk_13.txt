lie in the positive half space of this line right so this is my line and i'm going to look.
at the points which lie in the positive half space what is the positive half space it means that w.
transpose x should be greater than 0 right so here are these points now my question is what would be.
the angle between these points and the weight vector w without knowing anything just that by looking at the picture.
you should be able to tell me that this angle would be less than 90 degrees right it's obvious from.
the picture right and why is oh let's let's see if i want to answer this now and now let's.
look at some points which lie in the negative half space right which are these red points what would be.
and by definition if it's in the negative half space and w transpose x is less than zero so what.
would be the angle between these points and the weight vector again just by looking at the picture it is.
