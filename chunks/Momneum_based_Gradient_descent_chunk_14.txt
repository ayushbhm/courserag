base algorithm is moving faster and we understand why that is also happening right let's look at the other view.
now so this is the contour map you understand what the contour map is so this region here is a.
flat region so this region here is a flat region and then here that the slope is very Steep and.
then again here the slope is very gentle this is again the slope is steep these are again flat regions.
right so you understand what that is so this is just the contour map corresponding to the 3D plot that.
we had and now we'll try to run uh gradient descent on this contour map it's nothing different from what.
I have shown here but now I can see the other view of what is happening to the sigmoid function.
and you will see something interesting here right so let's run it of course it's moving very fast and it's.
almost reached there but then again it has moved far and then again come to something which is some things.
