processing especially in modern multilingual models we want certain portions of the network to only adhere to computations related to.
a certain language or even now certain inputs right and the rest of the network may be doing other things.
and so on right so you can just look at this video also which is uh again another kind of.
a debate about brains the first one was whether it's single or distribu or disconnected now this is more about.
whether it's localized or distributed right and both of these are relevant even today in terms of modern deep neural.
networks right so from these uh biological neurons where the inspiration for neural networks came now let's move to the.
actual artificial neuron set and that's where this period of time that we'll cover which is called the spring to.
the winter of ai and i'll tell you why these two seasons have cropped up in us in our discussion.
right so around 1943 while we were still trying to understand uh what uh the brain is and we are.
