but the key thing that you need to at least be happy about right now is that unlike a random.
gas guess algorithm here you are not making a mistake at any point at every time step your loss is.
definitely decrease right so that's that's what is happening here so this is a demonstration of the gradient descent algorithm.
on the toy example that we had using the code that I had on the previous slide which was in.
turn based on the gradient descent update right um so later on in this course we look at gradient descent.
in much more detail and we look at a lot of its variance right so for now it suffices to.
know that we have an algorithm for learning the parameters of a sigma material and I've just shown you the.
algorithm I have shown you the Mac behind it I have shown you the visual interpretation of that and I've.
also shown you how to code it and then run it so that you move on the loss function in.
