family of models of our cnn which came out and in parallel and image classification we had rest network so.
2015 all of this is convolutional neural network based models and we also had convolutional neural network based models for.
object detection right and it continued for a while then in 2017 transformers came in nlp right so that's it's.
just like slightly you have to look at different timelines here but in 2017 17 is when transformers came and.
then by 2019 we had transformers enter uh the image classification scene and then they have entered the object detection.
scene also so now even the image classification object detection uh models uh the state-of-the-art models are based on uh.
transformers now right and this is kind of again replaced the convolutional neural network based models largely right i mean.
of course it's not saying that they're completely out but since which have been around since 1980s right so we.
