equal to this quantity ok now this is a joke that I have every year with my students you don't.
ask me what Stein's Lemma is and I will not ask you what Stein's Lemma is but we just for.
this discussion we just need to take it for granted that Stein Slimmer says that this expectation that you are.
interested in is actually equal to this quantity right now if you take this on face value if you just.
assume that time slamma is good is correct then from here on let's see what answers do we get right.
where do we reach if we assume that this is actually correct and this is actually correct because Stein's Lima.
has proven this right ah okay so now if this is indeed correct then what is happening here right so.
when will this quantity that you have here this quantity right which is the same as this quantity that you.
have when will that be high right this is a derivative so what does that mean that if you have.
