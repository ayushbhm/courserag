it has a nose right and you have dropped this guy house now there is no node in this layer.
which is detecting noses hence the other guys will have to wake up and say that hey I cannot rely.
on anyone else I cannot co-adapt because this guy is unreliable and sometimes he is active sometimes he is not.
active so better I also learn how to detect nose in addition to learning how to detect say ice right.
so every node will now have to act independently and take more responsibility right so this is what actually happens.
in a Dropout and I'll just now Flash the content on the slides yeah so either the multiple nodes need.
to learn how to detect noses or other nodes to need to learn how to detect noses how to detect.
the face even if the nose detecting neuron is not active that means some other node needs to now detect.
how to uh I mean detect a face using ice let's say what the problem here is simple and I'm.
