be less than 0 that's the condition that I have right so I am interested in the values which are.
less than 0. so now if I'm interested in values less than 0 I should ask this question right how.
less can I be and the more or less the better right because what is what is this quantity this.
quantity is the difference between the new loss and the current loss right and I the more negative this difference.
the better right that means my new loss is as low as it can be from the current loss right.
and when would this be when would this difference be maximum when uh this quantity is as low as it.
can be right because this quantity can be as negative as it can be and this is that quantity it.
can be as this is how negative it can be and when will be that negative when the angle or.
the cosine of the angle is minus 1 because this condition is directly been derived from here right so if.
the cosine of the angle is minus 1 that's when I will get the most negative value for this quantity.
