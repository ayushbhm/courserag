which is 0 in this case and 1 minus beta time the current update that we have made but the.
current update which is Delta is in turn a function of this nabla so I've just substituted the value of.
delta uh W naught and in terms of uh sorry uh yeah Delta W naught in terms of navbla w.
naught right so this is nabla just in case you're confused and this is Delta okay so that's done okay.
now let's see what happens next I'll just keep continuing for a while so fraction of the history is being.
stored for the next iteration now at t equal to 1 again you will just apply this B1 is equal.
to 0.9 into the previous history plus point one into the current gradient and if I substitute the value of.
the prevent history then I get the entire equation in terms of the nav loss so nabla w 0 square.
and abla W1 square right now I again uh do the update and now I'm ignoring the Epsilon because I.
have reached a state where I have non-zero U naught and Epsilon is very small so U naught plus Epsilon.
