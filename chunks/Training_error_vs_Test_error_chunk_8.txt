it could to fit those points properly and in that effort it might have now missed uh considering the other.
points which are unseen right and for those points it will make a high error right so this is typically.
the behavior that the training error will keep Inc decreasing as the model complexity increasing the test error will decrease.
up to a certain point but if you make the model extremely complex it is going to overfit on the.
training data and make severe errors on the test data right so what you are looking for is The Sweet.
Spot somewhere in the center right and on the left hand side you have high bias models like the simple.
models which give you very high error both on the training data as well as test data right because the.
simple line model even on the training data it was giving us a high error it was nowhere close to.
the two sinusoidal function and on the right hand side you have the high variance models which give a low.
