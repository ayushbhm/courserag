picking up random data points at every time step so depending on the time data point that I have picked.
up my derivatives might be different and this is the distribution that I expect them to follow right and this.
distribution might change at different time steps but I am making this assumption that all at all time steps the.
distribution Remains the Same that means the expected value at any time step is equal to the same way so.
I am clocking that expected value of is the same for all the time steps that's one simplifying assumption that.
I have made and under that assumption now let's see where we reach so now we have made this assumption.
that all the derivatives were the same so then we have this expected value of delta w t now I.
can just it's it does not depend on the time safety anymore right so I can take it outside the.
summation so then I have 1 minus beta into expected value of delta W into that summation that I had.
