too much on the current gradient right because you might get a sudden High gradient and then you might take.
a very large step and you might not want to rely too much on the current gradient this is the.
same explanation as we have in momentum where you want to keep looking at the history if I am constantly.
moving in a direction then I want to keep some weightage for the history also and then not make sudden.
movements based on just the current derivative right so that's what that's why you have this exponentially weighted average so.
that you have more weightage for the history because history has accumulated over time and less weightage for the current.
point in time gradient right so so one way of looking at this is that you are actually right what.
you want in empty is that you want to look at the expected value of the gradient as opposed to.
this current value of the gradient right so instead of just looking at the current gradient I would have ideally.
