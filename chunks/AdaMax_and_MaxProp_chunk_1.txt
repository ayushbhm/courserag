now if you try to visualize it now for L one the shape looks like this right so what does.
that mean that for any point on this surface the norm is going to be 1 right and you can.
see that so this point for example here is minus 0.5 sorry 0.5 comma minus 0.5 foreign with this right.
and now if I substitute that in this formula I'll get the answer as 1. right so all the points.
which lie on this uh uh Square they all are going to have the norm as uh one right and.
now if you look at L2 Norm you would have seen this oops yeah so if you look at LD.
Norm now all the points lying on this circle would have are the enormous one and it makes sense right.
because the equation that you get is the following right so I'm saying that X1 I'll not use the mod.
here because anyways I'm squaring okay let me just write the mod plus X2 Square equal to 1 right you.
are looking for All Points which satisfy this equation and of course they will lie on a circle right so.
