it again so I was saying that it was perhaps oscillating from this point to this point and then back.
and forth between these two points right and if the ETA was such that uh even though the the denominator.
has become more or less constant if the effective learning rate because of the initial learning rated so it depends.
on the initial learning rate if that was such that instead of just moving from the two symmetric points right.
two points on either side of the curve if it was moving like this it came here and then from.
it here and then from here then it would still converge right so if the learning rate is appropriate says.
that it's not uh kind of oscillating from one side to the other but it's gradually becoming uh towards the.
Minima right so if the learning rate is set appropriately then this could happen now of course this is hard.
right I mean you don't really know in this case since it's a toy example we experimented with a few.
