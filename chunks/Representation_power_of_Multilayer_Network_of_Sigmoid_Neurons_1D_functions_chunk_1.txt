but exponential but I don't care about that a single hidden layer can be used to represent any Boolean function.
precisely and the meaning of that was that if you have an N variable input then you would have a.
Boolean function of n variables and it would have a certain truth table now no matter what the truth table.
is right and we had seen that for an N variable input you could have 2 raised to 2 raised.
to n functions so any of these functions you can come up with a network which can precisely represent this.
function that means when you give a certain input configuration the networking produce the same output as is mentioned in.
the truth table right and the way we were doing that is by having these exponential number of uh neurons.
in the hidden layer such that every neuron was like spatializing for or every perceptron was specializing for one specific.
input right so that's what the representation power of a multi-layer network of percept transfers now my goal is to.
