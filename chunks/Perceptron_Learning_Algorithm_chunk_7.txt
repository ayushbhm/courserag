just going to do w is equal to w plus x okay i am not going to say anything more.
about this at this point if the point was negative and if my summation was greater than equal to 0.
then again i know that something wrong has happened because for such a point i wanted the summation to be.
less than 0 right but that has not happened so again i need to do some correction and my correction.
is going to be w equal to w minus x again i am not explaining why this magic formula right.
why am i doing plus x in one case and minus x in one case and how does this lead.
me to where i want to go and where do i want to go i want to go to convergence.
where my weights are such that that these two conditions are satisfied by all the positive and negative points right.
so how does this ensure that that is what is going to happen sorry okay yeah so why would this.
work right that's the question that i'm trying to ask right it's not very clear to me that why should.
