device right now each node is retained with some fixed probability right so every uh so every time I get.
a mini batch for every node I take a decision whether I should drop it or retain it and this.
decision is taken with a fixed probability right that means with 80 chance I'll retain it and 20 chance I'll.
drop right so that's uh the decision that I take so that every time I receive a mini batch I.
visit every node and decide whether to drop it or retain it of course it's not done like sequentially the.
way I'm saying it uh you have more efficient ways of doing it but conceptually this is what you will.
do for every mini patch right now suppose the neural network has n nodes then using this Dropout idea how.
many neural networks can you create right so I have n nodes given to you and for every node I.
can either retain it or drop it right so it's a binary decision I'm going to take for every node.
