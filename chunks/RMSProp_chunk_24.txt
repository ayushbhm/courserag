is happening as the iterations go along we are seeing some behavior of the plots right in uh before I.
comment on that I just want you to look at what is happening here right so you started off with.
some Eternal which was 0.6 initially your gradients your history was accumulating right this VT was accumulating and you ended.
up with some effective learning rate right so remember this orange curve is the effective learning rate as what is.
happening in these regions these are the regions where your uh slope was high so your VT was accumulating right.
and even though this is uh exponentially weighted average you have beta into VT minus 1 plus 1 minus beta.
into VT as long as you are in regions uh where not really sorry current gradient as long as you.
are in regions where the current gradient is high this will keep accumulating right so as you are going down.
steep regions your history was also high and your current thing is also high so your VT will keep increasing.
