for humans brains it has 10 to 15 synapses right on these synapses i would roughly equate them to the.
number of weights that are there in a neural network right if i used to if i were to take.
the brain analogy of neurons and how the neurons are connected and then apply it to the neural network analogy.
of artificial neurons and weights between neurons or weights connecting neurons then then synapses would correspond to the number of.
parameters that a model has right so we had this transformer model the first model which came out 2017 it.
had roughly 400 mil 400 million parameters so that's where it would fall on the axis just to the left.
of honeybee then came the 1.5 billion parameter model gpt 2 then you had the 10 billion megatron uh model.
then you have the 175 billion gpd3 model and you have the 1.1 trillion g shard model right which is.
for translation and then you have this recent 1.6 trillion parameter model uh which is the switch model right which.
