that is just a empirical demonstration or an anecdotal demonstration of this idea that complex models are more sensitive to.
changes in the training data and that is the quantity that bothers us so thus quantity uh maybe I should.
go to the next slide I'll go to the next slide okay I can just do this slide first right.
okay so hence while training instead of minimizing the train error we should minimize this error right so now if.
you're going to just focus on minimizing the train error okay you might make it zero okay so now what.
is the what is your true error was the expected value on the right hand side is actually equal to.
the train error so this is what my train error is right my train error is I equal to 1.
to n sorry I keep changing M and M but I assure you understand what I mean this is what.
L train is and what I was trying to do is I was just trying to minimize this but now.
