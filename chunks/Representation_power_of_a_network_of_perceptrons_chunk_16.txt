and try this out okay now what if we have more than three inputs can you think of the same.
template now and adapt it for the case of more than three inputs the same idea will repeat you will.
have x1 x2 x3 now instead of four perceptrons in the middle layer you will have eight why because there.
are eight possible inputs now zero zero zero up to one one one so each of these perceptrons will adjust.
these red and blue weights in a way that for each perceptron only fires for a specific input right the.
first perceptron will fire when it's zero zero zero second will fire when it's zero zero one and so on.
right so now each perceptron again fires for a specific input each perceptron interacts with the green perceptron by one.
of the weights w1 to w8 so again when you write down the conditions in the truth table you'll have.
conditions like w1 has a specific condition w 2 has a specific condition none of these conditions will contradict none.
