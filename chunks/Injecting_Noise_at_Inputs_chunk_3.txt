has become harder because it's it's in a way similar to what you did with the augmentation of the data.
set right so you had an original two and then you passed it uh shifted to or rotated two and.
now both of these it needs to map to the label two right so now it has a more to.
learn and same thing you're doing here you had an original X you corrupted it and it has to map.
it to Y next Epoch you again corrupted it but this time the corruption would be different maybe in the.
first Epoch uh the say the first 20 bits were corrupted now maybe the bits from 20 to 40 are.
corrupted and so on it's every time it's seeing a different corrupted version of the input right and this this.
index here is the epoch or that I'm looking at and it has to map all of those two wire.
right so now memorizing the input becomes or this taking the input memorizing it and mapping to the Y becomes.
input because now your input is every time a bit corrupted so it has to deal with these Corruptions also.
