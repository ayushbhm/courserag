this one time step delay what will happen is VT will start looking at a much bigger gradient than what.
UT is looking at right so UT might be looking at these guys whereas V T minus v u t.
minus 1 would be looking at sorry yeah U T minus 1 might be looking at these guys whereas VT.
will start looking at the current gradient also and this is a very large value so it has more benefit.
from the current large value and hence it would be larger than UT minus 1 and hence the effective learning.
rate will again decrease right so that's what is happening here okay so that's that's the explanation of why having.
this two histories one delayed by one time step is helping because it allows you to catch up with what.
is happening in the history and then update the gradients according right so these values are not important but as.
long as you have understood the pictorial explanation you will be able to relate it to what is happening with.
