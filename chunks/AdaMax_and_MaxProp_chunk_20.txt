the using the max Norm for VT as opposed to the L2 norm and that's it right so this is.
as simple as it gets you just replace the uh L to num by the max norm and we can.
also extend this to Adam when calling Adam access atom X is actually an algorithm that is used in practice.
right so the key idea here was to use the maximum instead of the editor right okay so this is.
what the update rule for Adam Max would be so this is Adam you had the momentum term you had.
the bias correction that will remain the same then you had VT which was uh L to Norm and then.
you had the bias correction but here you will have me T which is going to be the max knob.
and since its Max Norm you don't need the bias correction and then you will have that update tool for.
WT right so everything Remains the Same it's just the equation of VT that changes and VT does not need.
bias correction in atom X right so that's all there is.
