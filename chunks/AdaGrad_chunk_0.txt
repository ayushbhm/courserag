foreign [Music] so let's see how do we go about that so the intuition is that we want to Decay.
The Learning rate in proportion to the update history right so for the features which are getting a lot of.
updates so I have a very dense feature so the derivatives are large and I updated it in the first.
step by a large value Second Step by a large value third step by a large value so I am.
doing reasonable updates for this so maybe now I need to be a bit conservative and Decay The Learning rate.
but if there was Speech feature which is very sparse got a very small update in the first iteration because.
the total gradient that I computed was very small again a small update in the second pass again a small.
update in the third pass then I need to let the learning rate be high right because I'm getting small.
updates so let me at least move a bit aggressively in those update directions right so that's what uh kind.
