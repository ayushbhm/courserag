but it became 0.72 right because initially my history was not large and hence the learning rate increased and then.
it started decreasing again and that's exactly what we wanted initially it could be high and then it starts decreasing.
okay and the same argument for B also uh so here for yeah so the same argument for uh B.
uh so the derivatives so here the scale is a bit different right so derivatives are on the x axis.
you have two thousand four thousand sorry twenty thousand forty thousand sixty thousand that's why you're not able to see.
the DWS here carefully uh so that again the same behavior happens your gradients change uh uh as you go.
along and the history keeps getting accumulated the only thing I need you to focus on in this plot is.
that your history is constantly increasing and as your history is increasing here your learning rate is decaying even more.
faster right so here notice that the learning rate starts off itself with a very small value which is point.
