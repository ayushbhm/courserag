which i am calling the positive examples because their label was one and some examples which i am calling the.
negative examples which for my labels are zero and as we have argued earlier for most real world examples the.
data will not be linearly separable that means you cannot draw a line such that all your positive examples lie.
on one side all your negative examples lie on the other side right so whatever i have shown you here.
is a boolean function right these are all boolean outputs and i have taken all the boolean all inputs as.
boolean right so this is a boolean function and in reality in real world examples this will not be linearly.
separable and this is a very real example right you have some n boolean decision factors based on which you.
are taking a boolean decision or a binary decision and now you want to be able to learn that what.
this theorem is saying is that you can come up with a network of perceptrons which will exactly implement this.
