foreign [Music] let's go ahead with our original goal right which was to find that Delta Theta which is good.
now what do we mean by good is something that we discover now right so for ease of notation let's.
just call that Delta Theta by U I don't want to write this Delta Theta every time so then from.
Taylor series we have the following right that we have uh L of theta plus and it's this is where.
that Epsilon comes into play right I was saying that we want the difference to be small right so I.
am at some point Theta and this is some point Theta Nu right this is what this point is and.
I'm saying that it's just a small distance away and this is where this ETA is important right it makes.
sure that the distance is small because we know that the approximations are good in the small neighborhood okay now.
this is L Theta now what are these other terms here right this ETA is fine right that's our small.
