have this sharp minima right because this uh the uh the the loss function that you have in deep data.
networks is not a good convex loss function right so it has a many multiple local minima and some of.
these are very sharp and then it leads to certain kind of challenges during our training despite all this deep.
learning works quite well in practice right it's also not very robust right so this is an example where you.
have the image of a stop symbol and now you just put some stickers on it right and for a.
human it does not matter right it's still the stop signal right but now uh the machine is reading it.
as a speed limit of 45 right so now it's like completely different from what the intended meaning here was.
right so it's not very robust in practice right so we still don't know right why this ah this happens.
right because it looks like it should not work it is also not very robust but still in very many.
