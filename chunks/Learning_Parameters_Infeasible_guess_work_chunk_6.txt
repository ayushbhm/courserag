b and that's the setup that i have okay now um what is happening yeah so at the end of.
training we've we expect to find the optimal values of w and p right what are the optimal values though.
these are those values which minim minimize the loss function that we had defined in the previous slide right so.
those are the values that we want to find so now suppose so now what do you expect right so.
suppose at the end of training i told you that i found w star b star what is it that.
you expect what would happen i'll ask a more specific question if i plug in the value 0.5 here if.
i pass 0.5 as the input and if you have learned w and b well what do you expect to.
happen the output should be the output should be close to 0.2 similarly if i plug in the value 2.5.
i would want the output to be close to 0.9 right this is what i expect to be and this.
is what i've written here right so if i plug in f of 0.5 then it should be as close.
