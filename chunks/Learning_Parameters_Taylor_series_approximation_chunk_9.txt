the interesting thing about this formula is that it has this uh first order term it has a second order.
term third order term and so on and I can cut off the formula wherever I want if I cut.
off the formula here I am doing a second order approximation if I cut off the formula here I'm doing.
a first order or a linear approximation so let's see what happens when I do a linear approximation okay so.
again uh delete stuff on the slide so this is what the formula looks like I've just cut off the.
formula at uh the first order terms right so I just have this much okay and now I want to.
find the value of w and I'm saying that I already know this right I already know what LW naught.
is right that is given to me now I'm saying that LW is just going to be this oh sorry.
LW is just going to be this which is whatever was my current value plus some quantity okay and what.
is this quantity this is L Dash W naught L Dash W naught is nothing but the first order derivative.
