you could have different values of K so my personal choice is always to go by the validation loss and.
decrease the learning rate if the validation loss is increasing right so that's the first method that we had looked.
at right now similarly you could have adjust the momentum right and for momentum there was this method suggested in.
uh this paper and this looks very uh complex equation but it is not really very complex so let's try.
to decode what it is right so there's a log here so let's and this T here the T stands.
for time step so at time step 0 you would have log of 0 Plus 1. and log of 1.
is 0 so this term would disappear so we'll just have 1 minus 2 raised to minus 1 right which.
would just be 0.5 right and this says minimum of 0.5 and beta Max so beta Max is typically one.
of these values uh so it would be uh or even 0 0 means there is no momentum of course.
so beta Max would be one of these values so now in this case it would be minimum of say.
