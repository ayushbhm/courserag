depends so what do you what's the mathematical way of saying that something depends on something y is equal to.
a function of x right so i would say that y is equal to f of x right now if.
i knew this f there's no problem in the world right if i knew what is the function such that.
i plug in the values of salinity pressure density all of these factors and just tells me what the y.
would be if i had such a function all of us would be billionaires right we will just look at.
different locations plug in those values and wherever we get the highest mining we'll go and set up drilling stations.
there right but that function is not known right so this is the beauty of the problem we know that.
a function exists the output has to depend on certain inputs right these are the inputs and you could argue.
about oh but maybe you have not considered all the x's i would argue by saying okay consider all the.
