been minus 10 divided by minus 10 plus 10 plus 20 plus 30 the answer would have been some negative.
value right and you cannot have the probabilities as negative values right so that's why you use e because once.
you raise it to e then all the negative values even the the answer for those will also be positive.
right so that's why you're using the exponent here and that's why the form of the softmax function right so.
for classification functions once you have done this computation you will then pass it through the softmax function to get.
a probability distribution right so now the first part of the problem is solved that my actual outputs were a.
probability distribution so now i have chosen an output function which also gives me a a probability distribution right so.
this part has been done so now given that both of these are probability distributions can we choose a good.
loss function right obviously as i said you could use the squared error loss function right but if you know.
