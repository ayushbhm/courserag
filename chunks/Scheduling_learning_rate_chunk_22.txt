the flat surfaces you might end up choosing the larger learning rates and in the valley regions where already the.
slope is steep or when you're entering the valley in those regions if you have a high learning rate you.
know that your loss would increase because you would overshoot the Minima so in those cases the smaller learning rate.
would get selected right so you're kind of in some sense making it a bit adaptive based on which region.
you are in right the flip side of course is that you are doing a lot more computations okay so.
let's see what happens when we do line search so you see what happened right so the gradient descent was.
moving at a certain speed it's taking more time to converge but the line search you can see that in.
the flat regions it was able to move very quickly and it also did not overshoot right it did not.
go out of the valley because in the Steep regions a smaller learning rate would have worked and it would.
