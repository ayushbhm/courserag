you want to assume I want something which is exactly equal that's also fine right but I'm just going to.
be a bit more relaxed in this uh lecture right I would just say approximately is also fine right so.
that is what I want can I construct a network such that when I give this real valued inputs right.
and I get a prediction from the network that should be as close to what is given to me in.
the training data right that's what my quest is going to be okay and just to make it more concrete.
so in the in the oil mining example there are already many uh locations where drilling stations have been set.
up and oil is being mined for many years right so I know what was the quantity of oil mine.
from those stations and I know what their X characteristics were right so what did the salinity of salinity what.
was the pressure what was the density what was the temperature what was the marine diversity all I know right.
