Dropout is actually trying to do and why does it act as a regularizer right so it actually applies a.
masking noise to the hidden knit so what does that mean is that in every you could think that Suppose.
there are n vectors n nodes here at every mini batch I am creating an N dimensional uh Vector where.
some values are one say 80 of the values are one and the remaining 20 are zeros right and that's.
the same as whatever output you produced here I'm going to multiply this by this mask right so if you.
were a masked out then you are not going to participate in the computation that means your output would be.
zero because I'm just multiplying You by this Mass Vector so that is what is happening here some units are.
getting dropped and this is how you actually implement it it's not that every time you visit every node and.
decide whether to keep it or not you just create this random vector by saying that I want 20 of.
