and you know the derivative of e raised to something with respect to that same variable is just e raised.
to x right so that's the only formula that is being applied here right uh okay so now let's get.
back what is this we just did that do you remember what that is so in the bottom i have.
the sum of all the exponents right so again let me just do this so i had a l1 al2.
up to al k so this the guy the denominator is just the summation of the exponents of all these.
quantities so that's what this what denominator is and what is the numerator the numerator is the exponent with respect.
to the ith guy so that means it's just the soft max if you consider the soft max vector which.
i had said which was y hat then am just looking at the ith entry of that vector so this.
is just y hat i right that's what it is this is the ith entry of the softmax vector similarly.
this is the lth entry of the softmax vector similarly this is the ellith sorry this should not have been.
