halves you see the right behavior of the learning rate initially it decreases and then it increases when the curve.
becomes flat okay so this is what is expected right this is what we like about RMS prop but what.
we were talking about its sensitivity to uh learning rate right so the initial learning rate so this is what.
happened when I chose the initial learning rate to be 0.6 right now uh so this satisfies our wish list.
whatever I just spoke is written on this slide now if we had set it to 0.1 right then let's.
see what would have happened maybe I should maximize this right so again let me just Define the things here.
you would have already understood but uh yeah so this is my history the blue curve is the history that.
behavior does not change the orange curve is for the ETA node of 0.6 which we just discussed in detail.
and the black curve is for the ETA naught of point Y right and now what is happening is that.
