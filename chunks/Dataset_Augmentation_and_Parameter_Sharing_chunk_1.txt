you don't need to manually label this you know that even if I rotate the image by a small amount.
of course for some things like 6 and 9 if you rotate by 180 degrees then you will have a.
problem but for most digits you will not have this problem right so you could rotate by a small amount.
you could shift it vertically right so the two being at the center of the image you could bring it.
down you could take it up and you would get a different image you could shift it horizontally or you.
could blur the image you could also change some pixels and add some noise right and both doing all of.
this you have just created more training data and what you're doing here is actually you are exploiting the knowledge.
of the task right so you know that if you rotate the image if you do any of these augmentations.
that you have seen and there are many such more augmentations in the possible in case of image classification the.
