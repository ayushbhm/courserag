you'll get a capital t z Each of which is going to be D dimensional right so you can do.
the entire computation in parallel and you can make sure right you can go and check this back that if.
I were to look at let's see like we can just do it right away um okay so what I.
would like to show is that Z2 is indeed if you do this large matrix multiplication Z2 indeed comes out.
to be the same as what we had seen in the figure right so let's try to uh do that.
so I'll just uh start from scratch so I had this T cross T Matrix which was Q transpose K.
right so if I look at the second row of this Matrix right uh so I'm let's see what is.
happening here right so this was Q transpose so this was q1 transpose this was Q2 transpose and so on.
and this was K1 K2 and so on right so if I look at the second row of so any.
ijth value of this entry of this Matrix is just going to be Qi transpose uh k j right and.
in particular if I were to look at the second row of this Matrix it is going to be Q.
