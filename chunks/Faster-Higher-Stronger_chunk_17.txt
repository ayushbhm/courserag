kind of popularize this research in rl right where are these complex games which require this 10 000 hours of.
playing and so on maybe only the big deep tech companies can do that but can you have simpler environments.
which have a lot of this complexity but you can you use those environments to train some of these or.
advance the research and deep reinforcement learning so that's why this open ai gym was released which became a toolkit.
for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms because this entire deep reinforcement learning based work is something that we will.
not cover in this course but it's important that you are aware of that that's one branch which you could.
explore as you continue on your journey on deep learning right similarly there was another gym retro right a newer.
version of that which had thousand games very different environments which people could experiment with right and again complex strategy.
