the magnitude to grow beyond that that means only those weight configurations which lie on this circle are possible or.
within that are possible you cannot go outside that boundary similarly Urban regularization restricts you within this diamond that you.
see there right and we even saw with early stopping that is the effect that you don't allow your weights.
to grow too much right so you are constraining the weights to lie in certain regions of the parameter space.
right that's one way of saying it right instead of saying lying in a small region or something it constrains.
it to rise in certain regions right now is the same happening in the case of unsupervised pre-training right indeed.
unsupervised pre-training is also causing the weights to lie in certain regions of the parameter space what are these weights.
so these are the weights or these are the regions where the weights are better able to capture capture the.
