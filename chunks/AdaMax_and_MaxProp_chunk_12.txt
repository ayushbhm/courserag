this could be possible because X is part so it's a x is passed so you in the next time.
steps when you are seeing the input that x is 0 so the gradient is going to be zero okay.
so this is again a typical situation that you encounter in fact this is the situation that we have been.
arguing about ever since we started the uh discussion on adaptive learning race right so now ideally we don't want.
the learning rate to change right uh when the gradient is zero so now you have looked at uh an.
update and your gradient was Zero you are in this time step and your gradient is zero you don't want.
to do anything to the learning rate right why do you want to change the learning rate at this time.
step right because you have not doing anything you did not get any update but now in the case of.
uh in the case of the max value this is what will happen right it will not change right because.
