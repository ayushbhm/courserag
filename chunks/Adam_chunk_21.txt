learning rate is 10 as opposed to 316 here right similarly V2 gives me a certain value if I bias.
corrected it I get certain value and now my learning rate is 13.8 as opposed to 316 here right so.
in the bias correction when I'm doing bias correction my initial learning rates are not becoming very high right so.
that's why you need a bias correction to make sure that initially you are not doing some very rapid movements.
because that could be faulty and we'll see also through an example what happens right so let's uh look at.
this plot here so here I'm going to compare what happens when you have Adam with bias correction and Adam.
without bias correction and remember our understanding is that if you don't use bias correction the initial updates would be.
very high that means the algorithm would move very fast right so let's see if that is happening so notice.
that this blue curve corresponding to atom without bias correction would make very large initial updates that's what we expect.
