set this to 2. okay so this is where I'm going to start now and now you can see that.
it's a slightly favorable point because I'm on a slope I'm not in a flat surface I am on a.
flow so on a on a steep surface so let's see what happens if I run now right see it's.
moving faster now it's immediately gone into the valley and I don't see now you can also see that these.
yellow dots are actually farther from each other because the updates are larger right so there is a corresponding plot.
being drawn on the WB plane also which you could perhaps uh see offline where you can see how the.
movement on the WB plane is happening and now again it has reached a region of uh of a flat.
surface out of a gentle slope and now you can't do anything right it'll just keep moving very very slowly.
and it is a lot of distance to cover uh to reach the Minima right and you can see that.
I've already exhausted my 100 iterations it's done I've done with 100 iterations but I have not been able to.
