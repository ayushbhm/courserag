foreign [Music] neurons gradient descent feed forward neural networks and representation power of feed forward neural networks right so uh.
before I begin just a quick set of acknowledgments so for module 3.4 I have borrowed ideas from the videos.
of Ryan Harris on visualizing back propagation these are available on YouTube and linked on the slide here and for.
module 3.4 I have borrowed ideas from this excellent book which is set in the see in the footer which.
is again available online and I'm sure I've taken ideas and been influenced by material elsewhere so I apologize if.
I have failed to acknowledge them and if you find anything that I should acknowledge please let me know I'll.
add it to the slides okay so let's start with the first module uh which is on sigmoid neurons right.
so where are we right now and what is the story ahead they just get that picture clear and then.
