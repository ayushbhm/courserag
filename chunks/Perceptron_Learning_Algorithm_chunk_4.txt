do i'll just initialize the weights randomly right and while convergence or while not convergence till i reach convergence i'll.
do something right now what is the meaning of convergence here so the meaning of convergence here is that if.
i reach a point right such that my values for w are such that for all the positive points in.
the data which is given to me my output is 1 and for all the negative points in the data.
my output is 0 right so in other words if for all the positive points summation w i x i.
is greater than zero and for all the negative points summation w i x is less than zero that means.
if i have magically reached a configuration where i have learned the w is because excise i don't have a.
control over it these are the data that have been given to me so for if all the positive points.
this condition is satisfied and for all the negative points this condition is satisfied that means i have to been.
