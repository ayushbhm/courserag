what is being told to me that you have to select a u such that U transpose the dot product.
of U with the gradient Vector would be less than zero only then your U would be good so this.
is a condition that has been imposed on my U Now using this condition I want to find a good.
U which not only satisfies this condition but satisfies this condition in the best possible way right and I'll tell.
you what best possible way it means right so what is the range of this right so this is the.
dot product uh between uh two vectors I think this should not be there this is the dot product so.
what is the range of this right so let's try to understand that so let beta be the angle between.
U transpose and the gradient vector then we know this right this is the COS of the angle this is.
just the formula for the COS of the angle and this quantity which I was interested in luckily shows up.
in this formula hence I am interested in it right so this is what uh cos beta is and the.
