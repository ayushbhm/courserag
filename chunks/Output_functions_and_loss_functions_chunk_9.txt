would understand is that it's through the loss function right so now if my network starts predicting the value of.
y hat one right which was say the imdb rating as thousand whereas actually the value is somewhere between 0.
to 10 right let's say it was 9.5 then my difference between 9.5 minus 1000 the whole square right this.
is my loss function this is going to be very high right if this is going to be very high.
then my loss is very high that means what is the network uh what is the signal that the network.
is getting that the current parameter configuration which is giving me these high values of the output is not a.
good configuration and it will start pushing it away from those configurations right using the gradient descent algorithm so if.
i get a large loss that's an indication that i should start moving away from those configurations and the network.
will start doing that so hence that is the reason why it will not learn to predict these high values.
