while making decisions i have given more importance to who is the actor in the movie as opposed to who.
is the director in the movie right so maybe these things you want to learn from data so these weights.
are now learnable right so you have when we're going to look at a learning algorithm for learning these obvious.
so like three main differences now you have weights the inputs are no longer boolean you could have real input.
so that was one action item that we had and we have taken care of that in this model and.
the third is a learning algorithm so far we were talking about hard coding or like like mentally calculating what.
the threshold is but now we look at a good learning algorithm for learning the weights right so what we're.
going to learn in this course is not the original perceptron or the classical perceptron model but more the perceptron.
model which was later refined and analyzed by minsky and pappered again we had referred to this in the history.
