try to draw the contour map for that it looks quite horrible right but you could just relate it to.
the intuition that we had right and maybe inverse functions are a bit uh perhaps I should stay away from.
that right but this function now now if I try to draw the contour map for this function it again.
matches the intuition that we had that in the regions where the slope is uh yeah this is what the.
function looks like so here the slope is throughout very steep right so the distance between the Rings is smaller.
here okay so we'll come back to the original function that we had yeah and I'll draw the Contour plot.
here and this is what it looks like right so I think if you play around with this function you.
will get a lot of insights into what the Contours Maps capture and the main intuition is about the slopes.
and the distance between the Rings right so now that we understand what contour maps are right let's try to.
