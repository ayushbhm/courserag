simplest choice would be to just do one over one plus e raised to minus a218 this is the logistic.
function that we had seen and we know that it gives values between 0 to 1 right so that is.
one choice the other choice since we are in the domain of probability is to use the cumulative distribution function.
of the normal distribution right so the probability density function of the normal distribution looks like this right this is.
a bell shaped and if you look at the cumulative density uh function then it again has this s shape.
right because it again uh at minus infinity it's around zero and around 1 when you have integrated over the.
entire uh possibility of values you will get a probability of one right because a cumulative density function tells you.
P of X taking on values less than equal to X so P of x less than equal to Infinity.
is going to be 1 right so as this approaches Infinity uh your CDF would hit one right so that's.
