would be uh so this quantity here is derivative of the loss function with respect to the weight W2 and.
if you solve for that you will get this is the answer and this is not very different from what.
we had already done right so we had this network earlier which was uh a single input x 1 and.
then you had this com constant one and in this case when we had taken the loss function and then.
computed the derivative of the loss function with respect to this weight the formula that we had got was this.
multiplied by the corresponding input which is X right and all I'm saying is that now if you have four.
different inputs and four different weights associated with each of those inputs then if you take the derivative with respect.
to any of these weights the formula will not change only the last X will get replaced by the appropriate.
X right so you can go and check this but it should also be straightforward because you have this W.
