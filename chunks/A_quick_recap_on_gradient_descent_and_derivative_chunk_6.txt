to the two points but what is it that you are doing right intuition is clear but what's the connection.
to the math path so the connection was the loss function right what you're trying to do subconsciously is that.
every time you are adjusting the W and the B you're trying to make that sure that the loss that.
I have which is the difference between the true value and the predicted value right is you're trying to make.
sure that that decreases that's what you are trying to do and you are able to actually compute that loss.
right so we knew what the loss function is we are using the squared error loss you knew the True.
Value you knew the predicted value and you could just actually compute that physical quantity and in this case with.
the current values of w and B this is how bad my uh approximation was right this is how bad.
my current sigmoid function is it gives me a loss of 0.099 now once I had handled for this loss.
