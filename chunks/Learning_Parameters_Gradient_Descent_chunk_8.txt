elements in this vector okay and you're taking the derivative of that Vector with respect to two elements so what.
would happen is that each of these elements suppose these uh two elements that you have here are your parameters.
W and B right so each of these elements would be a function of w comma B and hence you.
can take that derivative so when you're changing W you want to see how much does this value change because.
it's a value function of w comma B so how much does this value change how much does this value.
change how much does this value change right so you're asking for three calculating these three changes and then we.
change the value of B again you want to change how much does this change how much does this change.
how much does this change right so there are six values that you're trying to compute so then set what.
we are three cross two or two cross three depending on how your uh uh seeing it right so it.
