lot of this is english centric work and a lot of computers being used for training english models so is.
it fair that people living in maldives or sudan are paying the environmental price for training these models when similar.
models are not being produced for their own languages right so then what is the price they are paying for.
it's a very valid question to think about and again this is a very active area of research not trying.
people are trying to rethink about hardware itself to make the compute uh much more efficient right uh so that.
was slightly on a somber note right it was saying as we started off well we spoke about all the.
successes of deep learning but then we had this somber note on hey we should be responsible fair talk about.
green ai talk about having sanity in what we are doing just not put out models but also try to.
explain why they work and so on so i didn't want to end on that somber note so i'll again.
