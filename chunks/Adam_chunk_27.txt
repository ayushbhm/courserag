but also there is some noise right you see some up and down a movement there right and one way.
of dealing with this is to kind of say that instead of just relying on this gradient at this time.
step I will take the average of all the gradients that I have taken so far right or I would.
take the moving average of all the gradients so instead of just relying on this point for example this should.
be clear right suppose instead of relying on this value here alone let me just use a different color if.
I take like an average of things which fall in this window right and this is the same as saying.
that I mean an exponential average is almost similar like to taking an average in a small window because anyways.
outside this window your beta powers are so small that those points won't have much value right so here is.
you are kind of re-estimating uh the average in the case of empty you're writing it as beta into Mt.
