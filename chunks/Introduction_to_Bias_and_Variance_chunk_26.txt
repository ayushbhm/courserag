is very similar to I mean this is the definition of variance that you know from statistic right so you.
could look at it as suppose a fat of X you can think of it as a random variable Z.
then this is essentially expected value of Z minus expected value of Z the whole Square and this is essentially.
the definition of variance so all you have is here the Z is the F hat X which is a.
random variable because it is random depending on the training samples that you have you will get different blue lines.
and hence there is a Randomness there right so this is the standard definition nothing much to say here but.
this is what the bias looks like now what do we off uh see that all the blue lines are.
actually very close to the ah green line right which was there on the previous slide that means they are.
not very far away from the average and hence the variance is going to be small for the simple models.
