such cyclic learning rate which is the Triangular schedule that you could use and this here mu which is the.
uh period right so you could mu is 20 here so that that is the number of time steps it.
takes from going to the minimum value to the maximum value and once it reaches the maximum value it again.
goes down right so on the x axis you have the learning rate and this is the maximum value which.
is in this case is 0.5 the minimum value is 0.01 and the value at any time step can be.
given by this uh complex equation but it just looks complex if you break it down it's very simple so.
let's look at it right so if T is equal to 20 I'll just substitute the value t equal to.
20 in this equation let me just get rid of the annotations yeah so let me just substitute the value.
t equal to 20. now uh I'm going to substitute it here first right so when I'm Computing this quantity.
it's turning out to be T right so everything inside the bracket is T oops and now I'm looking at.
