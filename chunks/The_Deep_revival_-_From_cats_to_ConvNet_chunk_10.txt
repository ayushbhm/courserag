recognizing handwritten digits right and the motivation at that time was this uh Postal Services where PIN codes and other.
digits get written and you want to automatically be able to pass them to sort the letters according to the.
PIN codes right so that's the application is trying to use convolutional neural networks to take an image of the.
postcard and like kind of try to extract the handwritten digits from there and just uh and kind of do.
a recognition of what that five digit number or seven digit number is and in 1998 from his initial model.
in 1989 which was the laneet model uh he proposed several improvements and we had the lane at Phi model.
in 1998 and this is also around the time when he introduced the now famous amnest data set right so.
almost every newbie today uh in the first delve into deep learning that I think the among the first few.
data sets that he experiment with is Ms so this data set was proposed in 1998 and this is what.
