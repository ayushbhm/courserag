w x plus b this is a function okay and you have assumed that y depends on x it's capturing.
that and you have some parameters now how would you estimate the values of w and b if i give.
you two points maybe i should use a different form which is y is equal to mx plus c and.
now you would remember from my school that how do you estimate m and c if you're given two points.
you can get these two simultaneous equations and then you can find the values of m and c right so.
that is how we could do now in real-world applications it won't be like i mean i've taken a very.
simplistic example but what would happen is that you'll be given many such data points the key takeaway from the.
example is that if you're given data points which was two x comma y pairs right i have n x.
comma y pairs here if i just had 2 x comma y plus then i could predict the values of.
w and p right i could find out the values right and from that i just want you to extrapolate.
