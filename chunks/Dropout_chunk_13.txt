is being said in this slide so each thinned Network will get trained rarely because there are two raised to.
end networks right so it's very unlikely that this network if n is very large right which is typically the.
case that the same network will get sampled many times because there are two ways to end different configurations possible.
so it was also possible that some of these networks will never get sampled at all right because if your.
number of steps which you run the data for is less that run the training for is less than 2.
raised to n right suppose you have a million nodes the two raised to million is going to be very.
large and you're going to train for much fewer steps than that right so all these two raised to million.
networks will not even get sampled some of them would get sample right but still because of its weight sharing.
it's like every network is getting trained because even if this network was never sampled there were other networks which.
