is very low right whereas this was the reason where the slope was very high right that's just some observation.
so now you can see what is actually happening in the Taylor series approximation wherever you are you are drawing.
a tangent and you are saying that this line given by the tangent is my approximation for the original function.
and in small windows that approximation works very well right even when the gradient is large right so if my.
window is small oops then even as my gradient changes right my approximation is still quite good right so in.
the small neighborhoods my approximation always remains quite good even for high values of the gradient but if my uh.
my window is large then the approximation becomes quite bad as you can see here right so that's important that.
Taylor series is only used in small uh Windows okay now that was one now let me just reset this.
okay and I change the function okay I want to make it the sine function okay and now this is.
