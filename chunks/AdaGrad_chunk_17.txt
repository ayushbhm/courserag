the vertical direction will happen a bit slowly as opposed to earlier where it was quickly moving in the vertical.
Direction now you are moving a bit slowly in the vertical Direction because of this effective learning rate decaying as.
you keep making updates right so that's what is happening in this algorithm okay and we can now see that.
uh visually uh so here uh d w let me just annotate the plot a bit so here DW is.
essentially this Delta W that I have uh and BT is the history that is getting accumulated for the weight.
w and ETA T is the learning rate for the weight w right so now what is happening let me.
just uh show you things here right so as I had said right the VT will keep increasing right because.
it's accumulating the gradients of course at some point when you reach close to the Minima and your Delta W.
becomes zero then there's no more additions happening right so that's why this will saturate here in this region right.
