that this blue curve corresponding to atom without bias correction would make very large initial updates that's what we expect.
so let's see if that is happening and that is indeed the case right it has like gone very fast.
ahead and then it had to come back right it still converts probably uh easily in this example right because.
this is a toy example and it had come came back from the valley but you could imagine situations where.
after making an initial update it would enter some region of the Lost surface from which a recovery might be.
difficult right it would have reached a region where in that region whatever Minima you could get would perhaps be.
much higher than what you could have got otherwise right so hence this initially the learning rate is uh very.
high uh in the case when you do not use bias connection right and that's what you're seeing here in.
these plots also so let's understand these plots so when we don't have bias correction you see that your learning.
