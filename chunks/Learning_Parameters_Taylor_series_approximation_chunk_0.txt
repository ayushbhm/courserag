foreign [Music] with this idea that we want to estimate the parameters and we reintroduce the concept of error and.
what we understood is that in our random guess algorithm or the guesswork algorithm right we were actually navigating the.
error surface although we were not realizing we're just moving from here and there and at times we are making.
a mistake where we went up the error surface right or went to a higher error and we don't want.
that to happen right we want a journey which is smooth that you keep going down as far as the.
error is concerned and then settle to a point where the error is minimum right if not zero so we.
need a more principled approach and that's what we're going to do in this module right so this is the.
goal as I just stated that find a way of traversing this error surface so that we can reach the.
minimum quickly and without a lot of back tracing or like going back or not back racing actually but random.
