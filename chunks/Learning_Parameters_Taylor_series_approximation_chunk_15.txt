keep cutting the formula wherever you want and that's what the approximation gives how this relates to what we are.
trying to do all that is not clear right now right now we just want to understand what Taylor series.
is Taylor series just gives a way of approximating uh the function and you can use any order of approximation.
n equal to 1 n equal to n equal to three the higher the order the better the approximation okay.
so now let's uh kind of move ahead from here and see way to go yeah so now here's the.
same plot right and now I'll do some uh stuff here so this Epsilon actually defines the neighborhood oops right.
so the smaller the value of Epsilon you can see that smaller is the neighborhood that I am considering here.
okay and I'll tell you why that is important okay uh now uh this function is log of w okay.
and now I know the value of the function at this point here right this point here I am going.
