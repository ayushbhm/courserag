thing is that across the rows the entries are the same right these three guys are the same these three.
guys are the same and these three guys are the same right so if I were to take say if.
I were to take two vectors right a one A2 A3 multiplied by B1 B2 B3 right so this is.
known as the outer product of two vectors this is a three cross one vector multiplied by a one cross.
three Vector so the product is going to be a three cross three Matrix right so let's look at what.
do the entries in The Matrix look like the entries in The Matrix would look something like this it would.
be a one into B1 A1 into B2 A1 into B3 okay and then uh a 2 into B1 A2.
into B2 A2 into B3 and then A3 into B1 A3 into B2 A3 into B3 right so you have.
the same situation that you have uh here right if you compare all these guys were the same again all.
of these are b1s all these guys are the same all of these are V2s all these guys are the.
