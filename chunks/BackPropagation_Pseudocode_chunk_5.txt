this example what is the correct class right so this entire algorithm is run for one example for now okay.
one input X so that input you know what the Y Vector is and that's why you can compute the.
one hot Vector okay to this you know now from k equal to this is actually wrong this should have.
been L minus 1 2 1 right because you always start from the last layer and keep going on to.
the first layer so you compute the gradients with respect to the parameters I want to compute the derivative of.
the loss function with respect to the parameter in the last layer so this is k equal to l minus.
1 to 1 is what you are doing right so I want to compute the derivative of the loss function.
yeah so now you want to compute the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights in the.
last rear which is W3 so this will be a from L uh going from L to 1 right so.
w 3 uh which will depend on the derivative of the loss function with respect to A3 and uh H2.
