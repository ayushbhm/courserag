that make sense because VT is one step higher so once you enter the Steep regions after a while because.
this new guy is getting more weightage in VT that sum would stop start becoming smaller as compared to UT.
because UT still has to come to that step it's still in the older history and the older history was.
all high gradients so it's still taking more benefit from the older history whereas VT is now relying more on.
the current guy and this current guy will affect U T minus 1 only in the next time step right.
so now the history the U T minus 1 is going to be larger than VT and hence the ratio.
is going to be larger and hence the effective learning rate is increasing as you are entering the uh flat.
regions right and then you can continue arguing that once again if you enter the Steep region again because of.
this one time step delay what will happen is VT will start looking at a much bigger gradient than what.
