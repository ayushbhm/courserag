[Music] so while all this is happening great we're getting very good good models big models trained on very large.
amounts of data very good performance on very complex tasks like generation but there are also calls for sanity right.
we also need to be sure that whatever we are doing is interpretable fair responsible green right and these terms.
which are not uh so popular like 10 15 years back i mean they were just maybe being discussed on.
the sidelines now have become quite mainstream right because of these rapid advancements that we are making people are realizing.
hey with all this happening we need to also be a bit conscious about the implications of what we are.
building right and that's what this section would be about right so i'll start with the calls for sanity right.
so so this is the paradox of deep learning right so why does deep learning work so well despite high.
capacity these are very large models and when you start do a basic course on machine learning you will the.
