this case you are seeing very wild oscillations in this case you are seeing mylar oscillations and if I also.
draw the curve for 0.05 then that you would see would have even smaller oscillations such that it allows it.
to then settle it into the Minima right so this what these curves are trying to show is that how.
fast or slow the learning rate adopts actually depends to an extent on the initial learning rate right so that's.
what is being shown here so again multiple slides conveying the same point that RMS prop is indeed sensitive to.
the initial learning rate right and we might want to get to a situation or to an algorithm where this.
dependency can be avoided now you might argue right that I might find something which is good right so I.
might find ETA not equal to 0.1 and that is perhaps always good or ETA not equal to 0.6 which.
is always good right now one more thing which I'm going to make an argument for now is that that.
