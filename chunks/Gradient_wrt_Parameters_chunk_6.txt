and two here so this was just the uh I and J right so that's what this one and two.
are so I was trying to take the derivative of uh a I was trying to take the derivative of.
a K2 with respect to w k this was the guy right so this was again 2 2 and my.
the answer which I got was h one two in this case right so this is actually I minus 1.
and this is J so that's what our formula is going to be right so let me just delete all.
of this and show you the formula it's going to be uh K minus 1 sorry that was K minus.
1 so I got H 1 2 so this one is for the previous layer so it's K minus 1.
and the jth neuron in that layer so G right so that's how I got this answer so we just.
did that derivative I'm sorry I made some mistakes there but if you go back and look at it I.
think it should be fine so we got this as the answer so this is the derivative of the loss.
function with one element of the weight Matrix w k right so if I look at the derivative of the.
