because in particular right when could you do that in parallel so let me call this Alpha Street right or.
I could have used the timestamp so one two three four five six right so this is Alpha six Alpha.
six one alpha six two three all the way up to Alpha six capital T and say this is Alpha.
two one alpha two two all the way up to Alpha to T right now when can I compute these.
in parallel earlier remember we had spoken that uh when we are looking at encoder decoder I could not compute.
two rows of alpha in parallel because this row of alpha depended on everything that happened before right but now.
I don't have that dependency to compute this Alpha I just need H2 and H1 which I already have to.
compute this I need H6 and H3 which I already have I don't need to see what is happening here.
to be able to compute this function right so you already have a feeling that all these rows can be.
