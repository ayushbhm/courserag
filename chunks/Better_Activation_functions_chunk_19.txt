neuron which had a range between minus one to one then it would have been possible some of these Blues.
were positive some of these Blues were negative and then accordingly the the vectors the elements of the vector some.
of them would be positive some of them would be negative but because you are using a sigmoid neuron all.
W's are positive and hence all the elements of the gradient Vector would have the same sign now what is.
the problem with that that is I've just told you what the what is happening but we don't know what.
the problem with that is right so this is just in words whatever I explained so let's see what the.
problem is right so this is the uh uh say derivative of the partial derivative with respect to W1 partial.
derivative with respect to W2 so now if I consider the plane right which has uh all possible values of.
partial derivative of W1 and W2 so now which are the quadrants which are possible either the quadrant where both.
