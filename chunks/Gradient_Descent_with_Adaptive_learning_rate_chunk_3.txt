is the data about one movie and there would be many such movies so say this is the movie one.
so then we have x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 3 x 1 4. right so that's the.
notation that we are using so these are all the individual inputs that are going to the network and a.
collection of such inputs forms one training point or one uh data point right so that's the idea okay uh.
and so this is the notation and now uh so we have multiple weights now right we have W and.
W2 w3w4 and for the minute I have ignored the bias so now given this network that it should be.
easy that for a given a single data point right which is uh X and it should have been X.
comma y not X comma B sorry this should have been y so a single training point is the input.
X and the output y now if you wanted the derivative of the loss function with respect to W1 which.
is one of the weights in this network right so remember earlier we had derived when we just had one.
