correct class is the second class then when i evaluate this indicator variable which is l equal to 1 i'll.
get the answer as 0 for the next one i'll get the answer as 1 and everywhere else i'll get.
a 0 right similarly if l is equal to 3 then i'll get 0 0 1 and then all 0.
right so any only one of these elements would be one so these kind of vectors are called one hot.
vector because only one of their entries is going to be one right so let me just clear the slide.
okay so this is what it looks like i'm going to call this vector as the one hot vector e.
l where this contains a one in the l position this is a vector containing one in the l position.
and zero everywhere else and that's just a more compact way of writing this i have not done anything new.
i've just introduced a new notation for the vector e right okay ah so so far so good right so.
what have we been able to do so far remember that this was h3 this part was h3 which was.
