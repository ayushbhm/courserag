the partial derivatives of all the elements at one goal right so that's what my quest is going to be.
but if i can do that then i am done right so this is where we are this is what.
the intuition is you can use the gradient descent algorithm as it is provided you have these quantities so we.
need to answer two questions how to choose the loss function why do we need to answer this question because.
we need to compute the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weights right so unless i.
know what the loss function is i can't even start writing down what that formula is going to be so.
i need to know how to choose the loss function and once we choose the loss function i need to.
compute every element of the gradient vector right which is the partial derivatives with respect to all the weights that.
i had in the network right so if i know these two then i'll just come back to my gradient.
