lot right hence derivative or partial derivatives is a good way of assigning responsibility to the weights for the loss.
because it tells me if i change this weight a bit how much will the loss change and that's what.
i want to know right how much is this guy responsible can i change its value a bit and drastically.
reduce the loss function then let me do that and that is what the partial derivative tells right so from.
that english discussion that we had of talking to every guy we came to this mathematical uh kind of realization.
of that which is that you just need to compute the partial derivatives and if you want to compute the.
partial derivative then just as we had this uh detective work that we did we went and spoke to every.
layer and then came to the last guy we just have to do the same thing which just gives us.
the chain rule of property right so this is what we are going to do in the remaining part of.
