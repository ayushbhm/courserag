foreign [Music] descent and we'll see whether it tries to fix the problem so what were our observations about gradient.
descent that it takes a lot of time to navigate regions having a gentle slope right so wherever we have.
gentle slope and now again connecting it to the discussion on Contours gender slope means if you have two successive.
Rings the distance between them would be very large and in those gentle slope regions it takes a long time.
and the intuition is clear because on those slopes the gradients are small and if the gradients are small your.
updates are small so at every Point you're moving like a very very very small step so it'll take a.
lot of steps to get out of that flat surface right and this is what is explained here so can.
we do something better so let's take a look at momentum based gradient descent okay uh so there's the intuition.
right and uh I'll repeat the intuition which I always give for this right so uh this would be relevant.
