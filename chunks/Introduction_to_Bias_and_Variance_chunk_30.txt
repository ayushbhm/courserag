would perform very bad right whereas if my model has a low variance then irrespective of what training data I.
have all my f hat X's would be very close to each other so now if I had used this.
as a training data and then my test data comes from any of these other remaining data then I do.
not have a problem because my f hat X would have been similar right but at the same time it.
should not be the case that this low variance is coming with high bias because if there is high bias.
then I know that all my f hat X's would be close to each other but then they will be.
far away from the true function which is again useless to me right so there has to be this balance.
that you want like you want a low bias by the same time you don't want a high variance or.
you do other way of looking at it is that you want low variance but at the same time you.
don't want a high bias in the model right so you want like reasonable variance reasonable bias so that your.
