[Music] okay so we are now at the last uh module for lecture two where we will be introducing a.
network of perceptrons right so now the word network has come in and will be seeing what a network looks.
like and then we will talk about the representation power of such a network of perceptrons right so what we.
are going to do is we are going to see how do you implement any boolean function irrespective of whether.
it is linearly separable or not to begin with using a network of perceptrons although we know that we're using.
a single perceptron we cannot build it all right we cannot implement okay so now for this discussion uh this.
is more like an illustrative proof right so we are going to not have a proof which has like a.
set of mathematical steps it will just be like we'll prove something by constructing a network itself right so let's.
for this discussion right we'll assume that uh true is equal to plus 1 and false equal to minus 1.
