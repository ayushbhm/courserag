uh wheat at time step T my v t is going to be given by this formula and what you.
see at V2 is just a manifestation of this formula applied at time Step 2 with the value of beta.
set to 0.9 right and the main takeaway here right this formula you can go back and ponder about but.
the main takeaway here is that you're using an exponentially decaying average and hence now your denominator is going to.
grow less aggressively and hence now your effective learning rate right and remember this is what I refer to was.
the effective learning rate my effective learning rate is going to Decay slowly okay so now let's see what the.
effect of this is yeah again I'm not going to ponder too much about the code here but you can.
see that now instead of only one line has changed right so VW plus DW Square I am doing beta.
into VW plus 1 minus beta into DW square right so that's the main change that I've done and now.
