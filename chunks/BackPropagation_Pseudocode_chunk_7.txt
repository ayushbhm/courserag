uh K minus 1 so you had started with k equal to l to 1 right so now at this.
point uh K is equal to l so K minus 1 would be L minus 1 so which would be.
H2 so you're Computing the derivative of the loss function with respect to H2 and for that you need the.
weights W3 which you already have and you need the derivative of the loss function with respect to A3 which.
again you already have right so this I already explained this when I was saying that you're just going step.
by step and then you compute the gradients with respect to the uh pre-activation layer below so this is what.
you want to compute and for that you just need this quantity which you had just computed and this quantity.
which you have already argued is easy to come right so you just this Loop just keeps going on and.
on till the first layer and you just keep Computing all the uh the the gradients with respect to all.
