understand that i had this big blue part but if i had already computed that then i can just reuse.
that when i'm computing this left-hand side here okay okay similarly for w two one one similarly for wl one.
one okay uh now let us see an intuitive explanation of the back propagation algorithm before we go into the.
mathematical details right so i've already told you some intuition that there's this large network of many weights and i.
want to compute the derivative of the loss function with respect to all these weights i took a weight which.
was like very far away from the loss function and i made a case that if you could have a.
chain from the loss function to that weight and you have a chain from the loss function to that weight.
then you could just apply the chain rule right so let's that's that intuition is already there now let's just.
strengthen it further right so this is what is happening right you had this network okay i gave you an.
