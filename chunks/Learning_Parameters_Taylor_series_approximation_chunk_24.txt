line in 2D it would just be a plane right so I've just approximated the function by a plane and.
you can see that in this small neighborhood my approximation is still good right let me just get the right.
angle so that you can see it properly yeah see now I can see that the my plane is very.
close uh to the curve but now if I increase this ETA then as was the case earlier my approximation.
becomes bad right so at this point my approximation of my original point w naught was here then if my.
new point is very far out of the neighborhood then the approximation would be bad but even in a small.
neighborhood the linear approximation Works quite well right and again I could just change the value of x and if.
I go to a region where the slope is changing then the approximation accordingly will become good or bad but.
that doesn't matter if you keep the ETA small then your approximations would be good right and now if I.
