1 2 is going to be the input to the relu function that is the non-linearity setting here and it.
will simply look at whether a 1 2 is greater than 0 if so it will just return a 1.
2 otherwise it will return 0 right so if you have any negative value being passed to it it clamps.
it to 0 and if it's a positive value it just lets it let it be as it is right.
so let's see what are the implications of that right so the first question is that is this really a.
non-linear function so indeed it is a longer function the max function the way it is shown here is a.
non-linear function a linear function would just uh behave uh linearly on both sides but this is on the negative.
side you have uh clamped it and in fact you can show that if we combine two relu units right.
so these are two relu units that have combined right so this is a relu function and this is another.
relu function and I have just taken the difference between these two right so you could think of it in.
