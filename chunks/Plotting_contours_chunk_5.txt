hang of this I want to put certain view from which the point that I want to explain becomes easy.
okay this is the view that I want now what you see here right uh on this plot here is.
that in some cases the distance between the Rings is large right not just that the distance between the Rings.
is large here but it's very small here right so I'm talking about the same two rings right so let.
me just highlight those two rings so I'm talking about this ring and this ring okay I'm not circling the.
full thing because it will just become a bit untidy so if I look here the distance between the two.
rings is large but the distance between the same two rings here is a bit small right it's quite smaller.
than what it is here so why is that happening right and you can see that it's relates to the.
idea of slope and that's why I wanted this other view here so if you look at this right here.
here the slope is very Steep and here the slope is gentle right so now if I look at the.
