function of course it will be a sigmoid function of course it will have s shaped but there is respect.
to the training data what should happen the two points that i have shown here should lie on the function.
right so what what that means is let me just draw it apply or close to that function right so.
i'm assuming it's perfectly done so this is what should happen right so whatever w comma b values i have.
when i plug them here i know that when i plug in the value 0.5 i want something which is.
close to 0.2 right i'm drawing the best case here that i should get a sigmoid function such that these.
two points lie on that and that's what it means right that when i plug in the value of x.
i get this y when i plug in the value x2 i get the other way right so this is.
what we are looking for it so this connects uh i would say the math to the geometry right so.
the algebra to the geometry that uh when you plug in these values you get some output and this is.
