has two components so first component is this so let us look at what that component looks like right ah.
by this I mean the whole of it right so first Lambda plus Alpha I so you have so you.
have a matrix which contains the eigen values on the diagonal everything else is 0 and you're adding the Alpha.
I Matrix so it has Alpha s all the way on the diagonal and there are n of these Alphas.
so adding these two matrices so we'll just get Lambda 1 plus Alpha Lambda 2 plus Alpha and so on.
on the diagonal right now the inverse of a diagonal matrix is just the address is just another diagonal matrix.
containing the reciprocals of the diagonal elements right so this would be what the inverse would look like every element.
on the diagonal would be the inverse of it right so this is what is happening here so each of.
these quantities is just going to be the inverse of that quantity now D is actually this further multiplied by.
