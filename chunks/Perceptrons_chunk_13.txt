greater than zero all of these inputs will have to contribute a lot right that means many inputs may have.
to be on and many high weighted inputs have to be on right so this theta is telling you that.
what is your inertia for crossing the border right so if you are a very niche moviegoer who only watches.
movies which have mad demon which are thriller and which are directed by christopher nolan right then your theta let's.
assume all the weights are one then your theta would be -3 and only if these 3 inputs are on.
then you will have minus theta which is minus 3 plus the actor is diamond plus the genre is thriller.
plus the director is nolan and then this would be greater than equal to zero and only then you will.
go and watch the movies if any of these inputs is not on right if either the actor is not.
what you're looking for then you'll not go to watch so this is the bias right this is what it.
