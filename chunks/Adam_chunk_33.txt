uh uh my value is 0.5 right so this uh yeah so this value is 0.5 and this term is.
going to disappear right so I'll get 1 minus beta uh into 0.5 that's what my Mt is going to.
be okay the pen is not working well that's what my Mt is going to be and my M hat.
T which is the bias corrected guy is going to be Mt divided by 1 minus beta raised to 1.
in this case and so now these two betas will cancel and I get 0.5 and hence my approximation is.
close to the True Value and now it stays like that right because it does not have this weight of.
0 pulling it down at earlier it it started off at zero then it got stuck there and it took.
a while to get the shape of the function but now it has started from the right point and it's.
now closer to the uh function right so that's that's what happens in the case of uh exponentially moving average.
and that's why we use this bias correction in the case of atom okay uh as we are done with.
