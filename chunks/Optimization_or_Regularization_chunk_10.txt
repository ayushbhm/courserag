weight initialization here itself now this entire space is not available to you at all right and now once you.
start optimizing L Theta from there you will be moving from this region right so again you will be constrained.
to region around that of course you may move out of that region right but you have done the initialization.
in a certain region and now from there on if you train you are going to move wherever you move.
is going to be governed by where you restricted your initial weights to B right so that in that sense.
is acting like a regularizer and in fact even if you look at the regularization ah the way we studied.
is that there is an L Theta and an Omega Theta the same thing is happening here right you first.
had an Omega Theta you said I want to minimize that and then I will throw in L Theta and.
then I'll try to minimize L Theta so in the case of regularization we were seeing that we wanted to.
