week some million other images will get generated and now these are all of these images are not seen by.
the train by the model during training and now all of this if you feed it to this model you.
are interested in knowing what your expected error would be right which means the average error across all these unseen.
images that you have right and average you can represent as expectation right so this is the quantity that you.
are interested in and if you can show that this quantity is actually equal to bias square plus variance plus.
Sigma square and it's not I mean uh kind of I mean hard to see how you'll go from here.
to there because this is f of x right and we had seen that in the formula of bias you.
had e of f hat of x minus f of x and similarly in the formula of variance you had.
e of f hat of x minus E of f of x ah sorry the whole Square the expectation of.
that right so these terms are there in the bias formula these terms are there here also and there is.
