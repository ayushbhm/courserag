an algorithm at some point right but for now you see the advantage that I'm able to move uh proportionately.
even though my derivatives are small I have adaptedly changed the learning rate ETA divided by the history of the.
updates and that is allowing me to do that right so remember my effective learning rate oh is ETA divided.
by square root of VT plus Epsilon and let me just ignore Epsilon for now so it's divided by the.
square root of VT and for w this VT is going to be very small because I am not getting.
large derivatives there hence ETA is getting divided by a very small quantity and if that quantity is less than.
1 then effectively this learning rate is increasing right and that's what is pushing uh the derivative there right and.
I'll just explain this in more detail on the next slide foreign but one disadvantage that not disadvantaged but one.
thing I want you to notice and I'll just play this again if required is that as Ada grid starts.
