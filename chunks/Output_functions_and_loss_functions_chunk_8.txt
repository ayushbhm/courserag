any values then how am i sure that my uh algorithm will not start or my y hats which i.
am predicting it which is the output here why would it be like thousand ten thousand 100 and so on.
whereas actually i just want values between 0 to 10 right so i want that the output should be 0.
to 10 right that's why i did not choose the logistic function because i told you that logistic function will.
give you between 0 to 1 right then perhaps i should have chosen something which gives me values between 0.
to 10 i did not do that i chose it choose a linear function which is not bounded it could.
give me any values it could give me 10 thousands 1 lakhs and so on so then how how how.
would you how would the network deal with the situation right so the answer to this as most of you.
would understand is that it's through the loss function right so now if my network starts predicting the value of.
