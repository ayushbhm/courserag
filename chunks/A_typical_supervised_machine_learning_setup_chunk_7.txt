n right these are vectors belonging to rn okay and this is some let's for the simplicity assume that it's.
just a real value it could again be a vector right it could be the case that given the data.
about uh movie i am trying to predict the uh box office collection of the movie i am also trying.
to predict the imdb rating of the move right so i could be predicting two things here right but for.
now i'll just assume that we're just dealing with a real valued output and not a vector okay now we.
have already seen what this data also could look like right so uh and this is where the most important.
part comes in let me just quickly go ahead okay this is not what i want to do right so.
this we have seen application right so let me just define all of these right so these are my x's.
okay this is a vector which belongs to r let me just call it m right because i'm using n.
for something else and i have n such data points right so in my uh just i have n such.
