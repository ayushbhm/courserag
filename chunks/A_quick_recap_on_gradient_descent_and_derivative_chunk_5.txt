uh meant that's what we meant by uh training and to do that what we decided is okay let's start.
with some uh random guesswork right so I was trying to take these W comma B values that you see.
here right and I was trying to move them this slider so that the values of w and B change.
and as every time I do that this blue sigmoid curve that you see was changing and ultimately I was.
able to come up with some curve which was passing through both the point so this was just random guess.
I used to move the w a bit okay it's changing like this I don't like it maybe I want.
it to come a bit lower so maybe let's move it in the other direction and so on right and.
uh then we were trying to connect this intuition right any one of you who takes this plot and tries.
to adjust it will definitely be able to come up with a sigmoid function of the logistic function which passes.
to the two points but what is it that you are doing right intuition is clear but what's the connection.
