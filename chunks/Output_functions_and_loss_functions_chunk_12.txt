distribution right so in the previous video the helper video that i just pointed you to uh we see that.
in the case when the class is known right you could still think of this as y being a random.
variable which can take on four values one two three four one for apple two for banana three for mango.
four for orange and so on right so it can take on these four values right and what your network.
will do is it will predict what is the probability of each of these values right whereas from the true.
label you know what the actual probability distribution is if this is an apple image then you know with 100.
certain because that's what the label has already told you so you know with probability one that it's an apple.
image and the probability of mango orange and banana is zero whereas your network is going to predict some values.
right point two point three point four point one right and somehow you want to be able to capture the.
