you get the queues at one go similarly now what is the dimension of Q right so let's let's look.
at that right so let me see how to do that yeah so this is say the input Dimension was.
d right and for I'll just take d as 64 for the purpose of explanation so this is a 64.
cross T Matrix right so each of these is 64 Dimension and you have t such entries now this would.
get multiplied by uh say uh so this would say get multiplied by a 64 cross 64 Matrix right so.
you could have just think thought of this as D cross D and this as D cross T so these.
two matrices multiply and I get a d cross D output in my case I have just taken d as.
64 right so this Cube would also be of the same size as your input representation but you could have.
different sizes also right so if you had chosen this as D1 then your output would be D1 cross T.
right and so you could have either the D1 could either be bigger than D or smaller than D based.
