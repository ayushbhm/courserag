respect to Z and I'm just going to sum all these parts that means there are M such parts and.
I'm going to sum the chain rule across each of these parts set and in any One path the chain.
rule this is what the chain rule looks like it's a product of these two quantities which is derivative of.
p with respect to q and then derivative of Q with respect to Z right so that's what it looks.
like straight forward this is what you know already from calculus and just quickly revise that right and that's exactly.
the kind of situation that we have here you have this quantity H22 you are interested in the derivative of.
the loss with respect to H22 you know that the loss depends on H to 2 because it is it.
depends on quantities which you are computed using H22 right which dependent on H2 so the loss depends on H2.
and there are multiple paths how many parts are there there are K Parts here right because from s to.
2 you go to a31 okay and from a31 you can go to the loss a32 you go to the.
