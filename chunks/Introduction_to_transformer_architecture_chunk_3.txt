case of translation right then my input is I am going home and I want to produce its translation in.
the target language right now the input is given to me at one go right the input is not like.
coming to me one word at a time where I just tell the machine hey this is the sentence that.
I want to translate right but the computation is not happening at one go right so let's see what I.
mean by that right so what happens here is that you get the uh you have the initialization Vector right.
and then you have this word I and then you pass it through the nuclear neural network so what you.
have here is say the embedding of the word I right so let's call this as X1 so this is.
the first words you have the embedding of that and then what the output is H1 right or what you're.
Computing here is H1 which is a function of h0 and x 1 right and now once I have done.
that this H1 then becomes an input to the next computation because H2 will be computed as H1 comma x.
