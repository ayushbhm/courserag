alpha that means alpha nu would be less than alpha that's what i wanted whatever was my current alpha i.
wanted my new alpha to be less than that eventually i want to get it to less than 90 degrees.
but i may not be able to do it at one shot so i will slowly try to make it.
less than right so that's what has happened here okay there is some hidden stuff here right so i've conveniently.
used this proportional sign and ignored the denominator all which simplifies the calculation for me and it makes it easier.
for me to show the intuition if you add the denominator and all you will kind of realize that it's.
a bit more trickier calculation but the idea is just to give you the intuition right so you understand now.
that with this update the alpha actually becomes less than what it was currently and that's exactly what i wanted.
right let's look at the other case if x was a negative point and if i was making an error.
