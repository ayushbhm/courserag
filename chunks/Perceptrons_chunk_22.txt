all the points which are in the red zone and in my boolean world there is only one such point.
which is zero comma zero so that is going to lie in the negative half space and that is exactly.
what we wanted right so this is a correct solution of course this is not the only correct solution so.
i will go ahead and yeah so i'll go ahead and change this a bit so i've changed this this.
is also a valid solution right because again my green region has the positive points this is not a valid.
solution and you can see here the error is 2 why is the error 2 because this is the one.
point which lies in the positive half space and it rightly lies in the positive half space there are three.
points which lie in the negative half space of which actually only one should have lied the red point should.
have lied in the negative half space but there are these two green points which are also lying in negative.
