can hold it just as i can add two dimensional vectors or subtract one vector from another i can do.
the same for these very large dimensional vectors also right so you can still use the same algorithm for learning.
the parameters of our model except that now earlier remember there were only these two quantities and we still had.
to derive this side we still had derived painfully what is the equation or what is the expression for the.
derivative of the loss function with respect to w what is the expression for the derivative of the loss function.
with respect to b and then substituted values in that right so we still have to do that computation right.
so it's just that our gradient of del theta now looks like a very very big vector and we should.
know how to compute every quantity in this vector right and we did this for those two simple values w.
and b and that itself was quite a bit of a derivation so our quest would be somehow come up.
