here right instead of directly going to the uh minimum all right so that's what can happen if your learning.
rate becomes constant and that's why you're seeing those oscillations in the case of RMS prop where the learning rate.
is indeed becoming constant uh after a while because your denominator VT is not changing right so it's accumulated history.
has also become like close to a very small number and your current derivatives are also small so now when.
you are adding all these terms from one time step to another nothing much is changing there right that's what.
is happening and that was not the case in Ada grad because you were just adding the gradients so the.
previous terms always remain right they are not getting exponentially weighted out right so what is the solution for this.
say this learning rate becoming constant and then resulting in oscillations so one solution is to set the learning rate.
