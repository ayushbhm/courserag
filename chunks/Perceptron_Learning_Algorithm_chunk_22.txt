do these steps make sense i still need to explain whether this algorithm will converge or not we will get.
to that later right so now let's try to see this algorithm on a toy data set right so to.
convince ourselves that the explanation was indeed correct right so we initialize w to a random value uh and so.
this is what my w is okay i will just initialize it randomly and you will observe that currently my.
w is exactly opposite of what it should be right it has a angle less than 90 degrees with all.
the negative points and an angle greater than 90 degrees with all the positive points so this is exactly opposite.
of what i wanted right yes w n suppose x w transpose x equal to 0 is the equation of.
the yeah yeah so i'm not happy with the situation because my w is clearly not what i want it.
to be so let's just run the perceptron algorithm right so what will i do what does the algorithm do.
it picks up a point randomly from the union of p comma n right so let's say i randomly picked.
