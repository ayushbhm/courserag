the product of the two expectations and ah so sorry I shouldn't have said that they are in sorry so.
this is correct so the expectation of this quantity which was what you had here you can now since Epsilon.
and the other random variable are independent you can write it as the product of their expectations and since the.
expected value of Epsilon is 0 you get the final answer as 0 right so in the case when you.
are trying to estimate this expectation from the test data this quantity disappears right so then the true error is.
actually equal to the empirical test error plus a small constant so what does this mean that if you are.
going to X going to estimate the true error empirically from the test data which is the first quantity that.
you see here if you are going to estimate it empirically from the test data then your true error is.
actually very close to the empirical test error so if this is what your estimate is going to be then.
