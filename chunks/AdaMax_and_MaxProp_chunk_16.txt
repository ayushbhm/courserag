again becomes uh 1 right so my learning rate is not changing and the same thing will keep repeating right.
the next input is 0 so again it will be 1.001 and so on right so this is what my.
learning rate is looking like so remember on the x axis I have uh so this plus one you need.
to do right so uh it was easier to draw it like this so this is a plus one so.
this is 1.001 1.002 and so on right so my learning rate only changes from 1 to 1.001 which means.
it almost remains constant as I am moving across and that's what I want right I don't want the learning.
rate to change too much for the zero inputs right that's and that this is ensuring that right now let's.
see what would have happened in the case of I'll just do the full stuff and then we start using.
the pay point yeah so now when I'm using this L2 knob okay at time step 0 I get point.
zero zero one and then I use the bias corrected value and then my initial learning rate at time sorry.
