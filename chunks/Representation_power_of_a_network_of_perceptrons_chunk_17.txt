conditions like w1 has a specific condition w 2 has a specific condition none of these conditions will contradict none.
of the weights will interact with each other in any of these conditions so you can find the values of.
w 1 to w 8 such that all your 8 inequalities are satisfied for any of the boolean functions right.
so again you will be able to implement all the boolean functions which are possible okay right so that's the.
same template that you have used so what if we have uh n inputs right more than three inputs which.
is n inputs okay so then how many perceptrons will you need in the middle layer 2 to the power.
n right so when you had two inputs you needed four when you had three inputs you had eight so.
when you have n inputs there are two raised to n possible values that the inputs can take right so.
each perceptron will handle one of these specific inputs and then you will have two raised to n weights in.
