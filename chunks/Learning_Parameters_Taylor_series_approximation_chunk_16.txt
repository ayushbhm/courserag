okay and I'll tell you why that is important okay uh now uh this function is log of w okay.
and now I know the value of the function at this point here right this point here I am going.
to approximate its value in a small neighborhood around it right and the value would be whatever is on the.
Orange Line because that's the linear approximation I have made that's the line that I have drawn and I'm trying.
to approximate the blue curve by this line now when the Epsilon is small that means when I am looking.
at a very small neighborhood this Orange Line acts as a good approximation of the blue curve right in that.
small neighborhood that you see between these two points here that is the orange line is very close to the.
Blue Line but as the neighborhood increases if you come go very far from the point that you were and.
now you're going to try it so this is your X naught right this this point here is your X.
