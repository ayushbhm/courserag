that but as I said it comes with an additional computational cost instead what if we'd have a simple uh.
learning rate scheme where we alternatively vary the learning right so we start with small go to high again make.
it small again go high again make it small just alternately slightly keep doing it so now we are not.
looking at history or anything right we are gradually increasing it then again decreasing so if it's in a high.
region it just has to wait out that cycle and then again the learning rate will start decreasing right if.
it's in a low region it just has to wait out the cycle and the learning rate will increase and.
then push it out again right this is a very simple schedule that you could use and this is one.
such cyclic learning rate which is the Triangular schedule that you could use and this here mu which is the.
uh period right so you could mu is 20 here so that that is the number of time steps it.
