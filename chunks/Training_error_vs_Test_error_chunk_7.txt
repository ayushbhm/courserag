error would have gone 0 as my model complexity increased right but what would happen is the test error would.
behave like this right if my model is not complex like the like the linear model that I had had.
which is the one which is the one extreme then my test error is going to be high as the.
red error red curve is I there right but if my model is very complex then also my test error.
is going to be high for reasons that I mentioned earlier because now I have trained the model to completely.
overfit on one training data that I had seen and now if I have another point which are not similar.
to this or which are not like which were not seen during training then I don't know whether it will.
be able to perform well because its entire universe was restricted to these points and it did like everything that.
it could to fit those points properly and in that effort it might have now missed uh considering the other.
