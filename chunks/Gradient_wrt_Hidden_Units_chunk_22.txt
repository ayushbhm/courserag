I am dealing with right so I have not done that yet I've only done for the spatial case when.
uh I is equal to l right the last layer so this part I need to do now so that.
is what I am going to work on so this is what I said right I don't know how to.
compute this quantity when I is less than L minus 1 that means I have only done this I have.
not done these two guys here right so let's see how to compute it and that's going to be again.
easy so this is what this looks like so I already know how to compute the derivative with respect to.
each of these guys right now I want the derivative of the loss function with respect to this so again.
I'm going to do the same thing I'm trying to compute the derivative with respect to one of the elements.
here here okay and what would that be that would be the derivative of the loss function I've already computed.
till here so then I can just use that part as it is and then the derivative of H I.
