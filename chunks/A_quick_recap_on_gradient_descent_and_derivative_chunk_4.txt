that and some of the content is also inspired by uh the course which Henry carpathy uh used to teach.
in cs231n right so I just wanted to make sure I mentioned those acknowledgments okay so let's uh start so.
this part as I said module 5.1 and 5.2 is just a reputation so we had looked at the guesswork.
algorithm so this is what our setup was we had a simple network with two ways W and B and.
we were interested in learning these uh weights right and what was uh the intention that we wanted to find.
a sigmoid uh function right or rather we wanted the weights to be such that that when I plot the.
sigmoid function using those weights then these two points should lie on that sigmoid function right that's what uh training.
uh meant that's what we meant by uh training and to do that what we decided is okay let's start.
with some uh random guesswork right so I was trying to take these W comma B values that you see.
