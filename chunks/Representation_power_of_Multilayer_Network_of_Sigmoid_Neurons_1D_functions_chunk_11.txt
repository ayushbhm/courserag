and it should be obvious that so this this this sum of all these towers right or this the function.
that you see here outlined here okay and I can just go on is what my approximation of the original.
curve is and you can see that this is a slightly poor approximation right I am close at certain points.
but I'm also far from the curve at certain point so the case in point being this right so at.
this value of x the actual function tells you what the orange curve tells you what the actual function value.
should be but my approximation would predict it as this right let me just change the color right so this.
is what my approximation would predicted as but the actual value is this right so there's a gap right but.
now interestingly right if I I've used a certain number of towers here right and let me just delete this.
now if I increase the number of towers okay this as you can read here is a poor approximation as.
