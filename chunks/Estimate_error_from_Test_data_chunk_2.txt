interested in knowing ah the expected value of F hat x minus f of x the whole square right so.
this is the mean square error ah indeed so here expectation stands for the mean this is the error this.
is the square of the error so this is the mean square error so the simply put the square of.
the difference between the predicted value from R approximation and the True Value and this expectation computed over a large.
number of samples right that is what we are interested in estimate but of course we cannot estimate this directly.
right because this requires us to know f of x and we do not know f of x right so.
how do we compute this because this has a quantity that we do not even know right but we will.
still be able to estimate this empirically because although we do not know F we do not know the true.
function f we have been given a lot of training points right where these y's are known so those y's.
