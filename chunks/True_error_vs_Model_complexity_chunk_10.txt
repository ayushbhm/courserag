we trained it we had a total of 500 training samples and then when we trained it using 30 different.
samples this line did not change much right that means my f hat X did not change much right but.
the same experiment then when we repeated it with a complex model right which was X raised to 25 all.
the way up to W naught we saw that when we take these 30 different samples which is the same.
as saying that I am changing the training data right and when I change the training data my estimation was.
changing a lot in the case of the complex models right so hence this quantity you can say is going.
to be high for complex models as compared to simple models right so that's that's what ah we are concluding.
from these two points right that the expected quantity that we were interested in in which does not go to.
0 in the case of training data is actually equal to this quantity and now we see that this quantity.
