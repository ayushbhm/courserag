a supervised objective but right now whatever I am doing is unsupervised ok now once I have done this I.
am going to repeat this process so what I'm going to do now is that I was happy that I.
had learned H1 well right from the previous training so I did that round of training and I kept training.
that my training loss reduce and my H1 was a good representation now I am happy with H1 right so.
now H1 is some say d dimensional input now I'm going to plug in H2 okay and then again try.
to reconstruct H1 hat right and I'm not going to touch these parameters so you can think of the entire.
training data that was given me the M training samples that were given to me for each of those training.
samples I have computed h okay I have done that sorry H one I have done that right now my.
training data becomes H1 I pass it through a network a layer called H2 right so this was maybe D.
