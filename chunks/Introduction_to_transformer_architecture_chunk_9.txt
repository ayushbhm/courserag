sides so I want that to happen I want to take the inputs from all the surrounding words but I.
don't want to do this in a sequential manner I want a model which is not recurrent in nature because.
the idea behind a recurrent equation is that you do something at time step T minus 1 and then feed.
it as input to time step T so I don't want that to happen right so that's the basic problem.
I have with the sequencer sequence a models which I would like to overcome right and problem as well as.
a good thing a good thing is that I want contextual representations the bad thing is I don't want to.
do parallel sequential process right and once this is done then you have the entire Encore decoder block right which.
then takes in the final representation so ignore this for some reason this s2s1 is showing up on the slide.
it's not supposed to but it continues to show up oh no yeah so this is the final State and.
