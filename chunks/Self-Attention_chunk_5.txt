here that's the question right so let's see what goes here the function that I'm going to use is to.
compute the score between q1 and K J right so now my this is my query Vector so I'm interested.
in knowing the weights of all the other words with respect to the first one that's why that's my query.
the query is the first word and I want to understand the importance of all the words with respect to.
that word so I'll pass different values of k k 1 k 2 K 3 k 4 K5 through it.
and compute the score right so I'm going to compute uh five such scores right so earlier this was the.
St minus 1 was fixed right uh because that was the state of the decoder time step T minus one.
that did not change so that was in some sense my query because for at time step T I was.
interested in knowing the weights of all the input words now with respect to my query or by my first.
word or my word of focus I want to know the weights of all the other words so that word.
