two other vectors which in turn had gone through a linear transformation right so that is what is happening here.
that is what the equation is and now I could do this in other ways and that's where the Transformer.
set of equations for uh attention will drop out from right but this is what is happening here the final.
computation is a DOT product and within that green Vector you had these two linear Transformations which were happening followed.
by a non-linearity right so now let's look at but in the earlier case you had this St minus 1.
which was being generated at every time step right but here now you have h i and h j which.
is they just have one word embedding for hi and one word embedding for a j whereas here you had.
these three vectors which were participating right so now from this h i n h j how do you get.
these three vectors to participate in this equation right so you have these three vectors participating in the equation but.
