think it should be fine so we got this as the answer so this is the derivative of the loss.
function with one element of the weight Matrix w k right so if I look at the derivative of the.
loss function with respect to the entire Matrix then it's going to be a collection of these entries and for.
any guy here I now have the formula I can just substitute those formula right so that's what I'm going.
to do now and I'm going to do that for this simple case when w k is 3 cross 3.
Matrix right so the derivative of the loss function with respect to w k is going to be a part.
collection of the partial derivatives with respect to all elements of w k and there are nine such elements okay.
and the formula for any such guy was this so now I'm going to substitute this formula to get this.
Matrix right so what is this I'm going to just substitute the right values of K and I so this.
is going to be derivative of K1 and then this is going to be K minus 1 1 this is.
