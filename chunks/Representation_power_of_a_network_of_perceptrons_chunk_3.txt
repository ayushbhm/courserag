the network and if i want to implement a function if i say i want to implement the xor function.
using this network that means that for a given input 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 the output.
of this green perceptron should match the truth table of the xor function then i would say that i have.
implemented the xor function that is what i want and now each of these perceptrons the red perceptrons is connected.
to the green perceptron using a weight and i'm going to call those weights as w1 w2 w3 w4 okay.
and then the output is y this is all the setup that i have now why this setup where am.
i headed all that is not clear but you cannot stop me from having this setup all this is straight.
forward i have two inputs four perceptrons and then one output perceptron for the first set of red perceptrons i.
have hard coded the widths okay now i'm going to introduce some terminology and this terminology is going to stay.
