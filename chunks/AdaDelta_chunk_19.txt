these different algorithms right from gradient descent all the way up to Ida Delta and other Delta is the only.
one which has this adaptive learning rate in the sense of not having an initial learning rate right so let's.
see and you see the expected behaviors right uh okay let's see let it stabilize and we'll comment on it.
so you see all of it all the behaviors that we expected the black curve is gradient descent which is.
slowly moving we know that that's does not have any momentum does not have any adaptation the uh the the.
momentum and the nestrov have the usual effect of oscillations and next of you can again see slightly better at.
dealing with the oscillations but all three of them have a problem in moving in the W Direction because W.
was relatively sparse so they first try to move in the B Direction and then come back whereas other grid.
RMS prop in Ada Delta they all start moving in W and B Direction and of these other Delta converts.
