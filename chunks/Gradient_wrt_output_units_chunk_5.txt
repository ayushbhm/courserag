there is i'm taking the derivative of one variable with respect to another and they don't depend on each other.
right so this is very straightforward i have computed the derivative of the loss function with one of the entries.
here any generic entity here and it would either be zero or one right so how do i write this.
formally does anyone know that so some of you might have heard of this indicator variable right so what does.
an indicator variable mean so let me just explain so i am going to write the derivative of l theta.
with respect to y i and again i repeat i can go from 1 to up to k right is.
equal to the indicator variable so this one here is the indicator variable i should have written it as this.
kind of a one okay and what's the condition associated with that i have suffixed something there so it's this.
is what it looks like i equal to l so what that means is that if i is equal to.
