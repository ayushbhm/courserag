suppose your training data set was about digit classification right and many of you would have experimented with the mnist.
dataset uh so this these are some images given in the MS data set so this is say one of.
the images that was given and whose label is of course uh two right so this is the digit two.
now what you could do is that from this image you could create some other images right so what what.
are the other images you could create you could Define certain uh transitions right so you could rotate this image.
by 20 20 degree and get a new image right and that image the label would still be two so.
you don't need to manually label this you know that even if I rotate the image by a small amount.
of course for some things like 6 and 9 if you rotate by 180 degrees then you will have a.
