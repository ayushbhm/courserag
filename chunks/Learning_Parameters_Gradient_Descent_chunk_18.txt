less than zero but we said let it be as less as newer as it can be and we found.
that that happens when this happens okay and that happens when beta is equal to 180 degrees and beta is.
the angle between these two vectors so that happens when U is exactly opposite to the gradient Vector right so.
that's why you move in the direction oppose it to the gradient vector let me just delete this is more.
negative is the most negative right not just more negative it's the most negative when cos beta is equal to.
minus 1 that is when beta is equal to 180 degrees.
