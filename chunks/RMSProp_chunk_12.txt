W axis I was here and I added the I mean I moved in the direction oppose it to the.
gradient and I ended up here right now again I compute the derivative here again I'll move in the direction.
opposite to the gradient with the same learning rate my learning rate has not changed so again I'll end up.
here at the same point because I'm moving from one point on the curve to its symmetrically opposite point on.
the curve this is possible I'm not saying this will always happen but this could happen right you're moving from.
here to here and again from here to here and you keep oscillating between those two points because from every.
movement you have the learning rate is constant so if the derivative is also similar you'll just keep moving from.
here to here right even if the derivative is slightly different you will keep making these movements from here to.
here right instead of directly going to the uh minimum all right so that's what can happen if your learning.
