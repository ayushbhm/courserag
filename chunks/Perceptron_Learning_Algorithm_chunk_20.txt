that's what i wanted my current angle was less than 90 degrees which was not acceptable to me i wanted.
it to be more than 90 degrees so this step has at least ensured that my angle and new angle.
is greater than my current angle and i'll maybe slowly keep doing this and move towards convergence slowly slowly i.
will keep changing this angle iteratively right because i am going to do this iteratively its not that once i.
pick up a point and i adjust my w i will never revisit that point right i'll keep doing this.
till i read convergence that will i keep picking these points again and again cyclically right so at some point.
i'll keep changing it and then eventually it will cross 90 degree right so that's the intuition that we have.
here right and that's why that update makes sense still a bit more to it right i mean some of.
you would start should start thinking oh wait when i see a positive point i make an error i change.
