I were to look at it from the top this is what it would look like right and this is.
exactly what the contour map looks like which is drawn on the right hand side right so contour map is.
like the top view of a 3D plot such that you take slices at regular intervals and then imagine what.
the slices would look from the top and that's what you draw here right so at any level here right.
so any of these circles or any of the Rings that you see here they're not all perfect circles but.
I can call them Rings any of the Rings that you see on this side note that for across that.
ring the value of the z-axis is the same right because that's how I've taken I have taken a slice.
which is parallel to the X Y axis so it's at a particular level on the Z axis so this.
ring for example corresponds to the level one right so this link here is level one ring this ring here.
is level 0.8 ring point six point four point two and so on right so that's how uh this has.
