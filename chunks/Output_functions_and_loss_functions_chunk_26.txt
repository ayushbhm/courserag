y hat l is this computed like this right so you have the input x it passes through these series.
of transformations at the end you have the output function and then you're looking you get this vector of y's.
right and then you're looking at the l element of that vector right so all of this is of course.
connected all of this is dependent on the parameters hence the loss function depends on the parameters and now once.
you have this all you need to do is know how to compute the derivative of the loss function with.
respect to the parameters and that's something that we'll do later yeah so this is what y hat l encodes.
it encodes the probability that x belongs to the ellith class so we want to bring it as close to.
1 right because that's the probability of the predicted probability of the true class so you want that predicted probability.
to be as close to 1 because we know that for the true class the probability is 1. okay so.
