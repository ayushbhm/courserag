to know in which regions was the slope Steep and in which regions was the gentle and now the contour.
maps actually capture that information right so you just need to look at the contour map and if I see.
that here the distance is large that means the slope would have been gentle here the distance is small that.
means in that region the slope would have been very steep right so looking at the contour map because the.
level information is also there I can actually guess what the 3D surface looks like and there will be a.
contour map corresponding to every 3D surface right so let us look at one more 3D surface the main takeaways.
here are this that these Rings correspond to levels on the loss axis and they are equidistant right that means.
they have been taken at equal distances on the loss axis the other is the distance between the Rings tells.
us about the slope in that direction if the distance is large then the slope was gentle and I gave.
