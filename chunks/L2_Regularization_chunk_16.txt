change that I have done here right yeah again I'm just doing a lot of steps but there's nothing much.
going on here right just like I'm defining some quantities and then using those quantities and at points I'm at.
some points I'm using the properties that the derivative is zero right so again uh there's nothing to uh really.
say much about here right at this point once we reach uh the final answer that we're looking for then.
I'll have significant things to say now this I can rewrite it as I've just opened up the brackets here.
so this is h w tilde minus h W Star Plus sorry W's plus Alpha W tilde equal to 0.
so I have taken all the W tilde terms on one side right so it's h w tilde minus the.
plus sorry plus ah Alpha W tilde is equal to H W star right and this Alpha I can write.
it as Alpha I it does not make a difference it's just multiplying by the identity Vector so I into.
any Vector is the same as that Vector right so it does not make a difference so that's all I'm.
