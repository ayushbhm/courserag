someone is going to detect eyes and I don't need to do anything then right I can slack I can.
I did not actually work much the other guys can do the work right so that's what co-adapting means right.
or it could be that hey you detect knows and I will detect ice I will only fire if there.
is a clear eyes in the picture if it's taken from the side maybe the eyes are not visible and.
you fire only when there is no sweat of course this is not that the neurons are talking to each.
other but this kind of co-adapting could happen where every neuron just focuses on doing one thing right but now.
if you are going to drop the nodes randomly right so what will happen in that case suppose this was.
the guy which was focusing on detecting noses now you have received a training instance and that training instance say.
it has a nose right and you have dropped this guy house now there is no node in this layer.
