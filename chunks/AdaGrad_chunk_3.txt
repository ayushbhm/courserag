rather inversely proportional to my update history if I made large updates then I degrees the learning rate aggressively if.
I made only a few updates I don't decrease it aggressive right so that's what is happening here so just.
as have you have the update equations for w you can also have the update equations for uh B right.
okay so this is the algorithm from now on I'll not spend too much time on the code right I'll.
just uh uh modification of the codes that you have seen so far so in this place here this is.
where I'm accumulating the history right I'm just taking the previous update plus the current update square right that's what.
the equation said and then my learning rate here is going to be divided by this update right so now.
I think these are small code Snippets which you are comfortable with and you can take the equation and write.
the code for that right so to now to see this in action right we need to First create some.
