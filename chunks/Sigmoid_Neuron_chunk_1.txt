add it to the slides okay so let's start with the first module uh which is on sigmoid neurons right.
so where are we right now and what is the story ahead they just get that picture clear and then.
we can start uh so frankly enough about Boolean functions right so the last lecture and entire thing was about.
Boolean functions where we were looking at functions Y is equal to f of x where both X was Boolean.
and Y was Boolean of course when we were looking at perceptrons we said that real inputs are allowed but.
for most of the discussion we were focusing only on Boolean infosets I want to move away from there and.
where do I want to move right so we want to look at arbitrary functions of the form Y is.
equal to f of x okay where X belongs to r n instead of 0 comma 1 or instead of.
like Boolean and Y also belongs to R right so what that means is that both X and Y contain.
real numbers right and so now let's let's uh look at an example of this right so what do I.
