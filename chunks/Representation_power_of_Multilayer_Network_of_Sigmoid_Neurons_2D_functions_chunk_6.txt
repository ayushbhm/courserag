2d i can adjust the w's and b's to get something which looks like a step function right so now.
let's try to construct a tower in 3d okay now i didn't want to show you this okay right so.
first let's see h11 right so i have taken one neuron again again the same idea i have a network.
okay where x is my input and i have one neuron which is h11 another neuron which is h12 and.
then both these outputs will be get added which i'm going to call as h21 right added meaning plus one.
and minus one right so now i'm showing you but it just that both of these are now this x.
is x 1 comma x 2 right so the functions are 1 over 1 plus e raised to minus w.
1 x 1. plus w 2 x 2 plus b right so that's why you have w 1 w 2.
b right i'm going to uh just use the same parameters for both h 1 1 and h 2 to.
explain this okay so now this is what h11 is looking like i have set the w very high as.
you can see here oops yeah i've set the w to a very high value which is 60 and hence.
