computing these derivatives so now i am taking derivative of a l i with respect to uh the exponent of.
a l l right so let's see what am i trying to do again i had this vector a l.
which had components a l 1 a l 2 all the way raised to a l k right now i.
am considering this quantity which is what e raised to a l l okay there's no denominator here right it's.
just e raised to a l i'm trying to take the derivative of that with respect to one of the.
uh guys here right and again you can notice that this only depends on uh one of the elements here.
where corresponding to the l entry here it does not depend on the other guys so this would be zero.
if i happens to be anything other than l otherwise it would be 1 right and we just saw how.
to deal with this on the previous slide so i am going to write it as this that it's going.
to be e raised to x right you understand what i am calling as e raised to x so the.
