the sum of this quantity that I have shown here okay now now what happens if a feature X2 is.
passed right so X2 is one of the features so in our oil drilling example it could be salinity pressure.
temperature Etc in our movie example it could be the director actor and so on right now if one of.
these features is sparse what does that mean that across all the M training points that I had happen this.
feature is always in many cases is going to be 0 right in a classic example for this would be.
if I have data for the past say 1000 Bollywood movies right and if I have one of the features.
as is actor Amir Khan now Amir Khan acts in very few movies so for these thousand movies maybe there.
would be four to five movies for which this feature is on and everywhere else this feature would be zero.
right so that's what a sparse feature looks like and again as you can imagine in real world applications there.
