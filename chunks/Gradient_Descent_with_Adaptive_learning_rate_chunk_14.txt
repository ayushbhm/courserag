not changing much you have initialized it to a very small value and then it's not changing much because the.
derivatives are small as I just Illustrated then you are losing out on the information in this feature right so.
you can't let that happen right so then can we have a different learning rate for each parameter which takes.
care of the frequency of the features let's say if there are certain features which are very sparse then you.
just jack up the learning rate for them right and of course this all has to be done in a.
non-neuristic non-hacky way right you just have some equations which automatically take care of okay if this was sparse then.
the learning rate is adjusted to high value if this was dense then the learning rate is adjusted to a.
small value right you cannot you know there are millions of features so you cannot have if else kind of.
conditions you just have to have some equations which inherently take care of this right so now you have to.
