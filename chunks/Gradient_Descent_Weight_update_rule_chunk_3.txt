could you do to make sure that this doesn't happen is something for all of us to figure out in.
the next couple of lectures right now just keep trying this right I've shown you what to do you just.
follow this and as I said it's like a setup as a game you could just keep trying this and.
see right and now you can notice it uh so far I was moving in this direction right I started.
here then I went to a point here then I went to a point here and now it looks like.
I have to come in the back Direction I have to come back and so on so you just play.
with this and you just keep following the update Rule and see that you'll slowly start moving towards the uh.
one of the minimas that are there in this function right and you could also initialize the W from a.
different point right you could initialize it from say this point here and then you will see that it will.
start going towards this Minima if you initialize it to a point here it will start going towards this Minima.
