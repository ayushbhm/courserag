you're going to train it using different subsets of the training data right now both these options are obviously expensive.
right because training a deep neural network is going to be expensive and now you're talking about training K of.
those right and even if I were able to train K neural networks at test time again I have a.
problem right because in test time typically I need results faster but again every test instance that I'm going to.
get I'm going to pass it through all the K uh neural networks and then combine their output rate so.
it's not just a training time I have to have a lot of compute but even at test time I'm.
going to have a challenge right so how do we then use this model averaging idea which we just saw.
in the last video is useful how do you use it in the context of deep learning right so the.
two challenges are that at training time your cost is high and even a test time your cost is high.
