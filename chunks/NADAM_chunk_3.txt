gradient at the lookahead value right and once you compute the gradient at the look ahead value then you are.
Computing uh empty as the history plus the gradient at the look ahead value and then you are updating the.
new value as uh uh as this updated history right that's what you were doing now one thing I want.
you to notice here is the time steps that you have you have t you have T minus 1 and.
you have P plus 1 also right and it looks a bit cumbersome and we're going to try to rewrite.
that a bit more compact it that's one challenge the other challenge is what is written here but I'll come.
come to that right so let's now see what happens uh maybe I'll just go back a bit yeah so.
let's say you started at w0 okay and you computed a derivative at this point so which would be somewhere.
here it'll just screw it on the plot so that's where you have computed the derivative then at m0 uh.
