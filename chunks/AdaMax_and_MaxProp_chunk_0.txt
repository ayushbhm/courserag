foreign [Music] move to a different algorithm and before doing that we are going to revisit the lp Norm right.
so LP Norm is Gen the general formula for LP Norm is as given here right and now if uh.
your p is equal to 2 then you get the L2 Norm right so then you get take the squares.
of the values and then take the square root right so that's the L2 norm and remember when we had.
introduced Adam I had said that actually we were using uh L to Norm they're the exponentially weighted uh L2.
Norm there and that's why I'm revisiting this because now we are going to see the possibility of using something.
other than the L2 Norm okay uh all of this will become clear soon so this is the uh yeah.
so we can visualize this so let's let's fix the norm let's take vectors which have Norm one right and.
now if you try to visualize it now for L one the shape looks like this right so what does.
that mean that for any point on this surface the norm is going to be 1 right and you can.
