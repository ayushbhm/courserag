we can show that under certain conditions this is actually equivalent to principle component analysis which is again a data.
dimensional ID reduction technique right and the same thing you are doing here you're using the dimensions of the input.
data right so that's all that we want to know about Auto encoders this is what an auto encoder tries.
to do and this is what I am trying to do here right so while doing so I am actually.
Computing ending up Computing a abstract representation of the input in this layer right so my this layer is now.
Computing a good representation of the input it's capturing all the vital characteristics of the input which are enough to.
reconstruct the inputs right so that is what is happening here and this is the objective that I am going.
to work with now notice that this is a single layer network network right so I had a problem I.
had difficulties in training a deep neural network so I've ignored that problem I've said okay I'll worry about that.
