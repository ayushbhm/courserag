something that we'll do in detailer and at this point I just want you to kind of break your heads.
with this and try to understand the problems that show up right I don't want you to fully understand this.
nor do I want you to get the solution but I just wanted to see what kind of problems you.
face and how would you change them I already gave you a few hints right that uh you might think.
that oh this is the global Minima but I started from some point here 1.2 and I'm not being able.
to reach there right then what if I had initialized it a bit differently would I be able to do.
that so what is the effect of initialization what is the effect of ETA as you make ETA very large.
what happens if you make ETA very small what happens right so just try to experiment with those things and.
just get your hands a bit dirty with this okay yeah so now we have the gradient descent rule that.
the direction U that we intend to move in should be at 180 degrees with respect to the gradient in.
