dou dou b dou w and similarly you could fill the remaining two entries here right so this would be.
dou b square and this would be dou w dou b right so the way you should remember this is.
the following right so when you are taking the derivative of a vector okay with respect to some another vector.
okay what are you trying to do you're trying to say that if this value changes how much does this.
value change how much does this value change right and if this value changes how much does this value change.
how much does this value change right so the derivative of a vector with respect to a vector would thus.
be a matrix right and what would the dimension of the Matrix be if this was M dimensional and this.
was n dimensional then this would be an M cross n Matrix right so if you had for example three.
elements in this vector okay and you're taking the derivative of that Vector with respect to two elements so what.
