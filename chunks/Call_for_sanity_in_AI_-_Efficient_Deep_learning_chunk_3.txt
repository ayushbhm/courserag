right because it looks like it should not work it is also not very robust but still in very many.
real world applications we are seeing it perform very well and give deliver results right so we still don't know.
why this happens uh and there are many such examples right so so this is again another example right so.
people have been able to come up with images which can fool deep neural networks right so i just i.
mean scientists have come up with these regular patterns right but now when you feed this to a deep learning.
based image classifier it thinks that the first image is of a king penguin right then you could just uh.
let your imagination run a build wit and realize why it could be thinking that right i mean there are.
some patterns here similarly the second image it classifies as starfish right so these these challenges do exist but still.
uh that has deep learning is the current popular paradigm and delivering good results in various fields right so now.
