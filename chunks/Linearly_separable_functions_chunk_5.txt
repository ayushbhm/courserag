not just be outliers you could have other things also now this is a very good example there is no.
outlier here the people in the inner circle maybe behave a certain way people in the outer circle behave a.
certain way there's no outlier here but i can't draw a linear decision boundary to separate the yellow points from.
the purple points right so this is very much common in many real world situations right so this constraint that.
i can only deal with data which is linearly separable is something which is not acceptable in the long run.
right so we'll have to move beyond this perceptron model because the perceptron model can clearly handle only linearly separable.
data right okay now this can handle is again something which is to be defined what do i mean by.
can handle we'll come back to this in a later lecture but for now i guess you have a rough.
idea of what i mean right it cannot find a line which separates the positive points from the negative points.
