need to satisfy there is no condition that is contradicting right and why is this happening because this is how.
i have designed it every neuron here every perceptron here is firing for a specific input and hence that is.
leading to a condition on a specific weight and two weights are not interacting with each other in any condition.
hence there are no contradictions that are happening here right so the network has been designed in a way such.
that you have four possible inputs and you have now these four possible weights so you have these four degrees.
of freedom so each weight can adjust to satisfy a given input does that make sense right so that's what.
is happening here i have come up with conditions which are not overlapping or contradicting with each other so hence.
irrespective of what the boolean function is now you can go and try the same thing for any other boolean.
function you can go and figure out the conditions and the same thing will happen you will have only w.
