the stick is in a different position say the top right corner instead of the top left corner then a.
different portion of the brain fires right that means as we're talking about this distributed processing so different parts of.
the brain are actually looking at different things in the uh scene in front of you right and this is.
essentially the motivation behind the convolutional neural networks right which is uh okay I think this slide statement is wrong.
this is uh from a different place we'll fix it in the slides later on uh this was the neocognitron.
model right which is uh uh which essentially if you look at it right here again the same idea inspired.
by the cat experiment that different parts in the image are being handled by different parts of the network right.
so the receptive field as a concept emerged here that for different parts you could use different portions of the.
