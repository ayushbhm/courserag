improving the training of these networks and some of these ideas about what these better initializations were better regularizations were.
better optimizations work all of this is things that we'll cover in the course right and then now at this.
point deep learning started becoming useful where people started winning uh a fairly competitive competitions right on handwriting recognition on.
mnist data set right then on a speech recognition and then uh visual pattern recognition this was on the traffic.
sign data so all of this now started materializing that now you just don't have it in theory that okay.
I'm able to train a deep network but using that I'm able to compete with the best models at that.
time and outperformed right so that's what happened around that time and then the image net famous image net challenge.
which came around which is I think around 2008 or 10 when it was first there and then in 2012.
