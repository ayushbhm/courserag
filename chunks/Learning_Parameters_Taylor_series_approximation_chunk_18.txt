the true value of y1 right so hence this as the neighborhood goes this approximation becomes bad so that is.
a key thing that you can do this only in a small neighborhood that means the difference between X1 and.
X naught should be very small that is one okay now let's see something else also the other thing is.
that as I increase uh W naught right I mean I'm just changing the value of w naught and you.
can see that the orange curve is a very good approximation let me just increase the Delta but let me.
reset this yeah uh now I'm just going to increase uh the neighborhood right okay now even with this increase.
in neighborhood the orange line still seems to be a very good approximation of the blue curve and why is.
that happening because the slope in that region right is quite less so my Delta or my M right it's.
very less and that's helping right but now if I change the value of w a bit right if I.
