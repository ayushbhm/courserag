this is the lth entry of the softmax vector similarly this is the ellith sorry this should not have been.
l equal to i so this should have been l entry right not i dash this should have been the.
l entry of the vector and now i can just write all this as this guy i can just write.
it as y hat l this guy i can write it as y hat l and this guy i can.
write it as y hat i right and now of course the y hat l here and here gets cancelled.
and so i have i'm just left with this which is uh minus 1 l equal to i minus y.
hat i right so this is what i have left with again don't fret too much if you did not.
get it at one go you just pause the video and you will get it at this simple set of.
steps so this is where we are right so we have the derivative of one of the loss function with.
respect to one of the elements of my output vector right and this is what it turns out to be.
and now i want to compute the derivative of the loss function with respect to my entire output vector so.
