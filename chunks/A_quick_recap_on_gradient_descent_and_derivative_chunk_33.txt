that's the drawback that we want to solve okay so that's where we are headed and just to convince you.
that is not like uh I mean this is not a characteristic of where I started with and so on.
and just to give you a different starting point right and if you see a convenient starting point so this.
here was an example of me getting stuck right on I mean I just happened to start with this yellow.
Point here which was on a flat surface right so I'll take a while to come out of that flat.
surface now let me just try some different uh initialization right and there was some suggestion on the uh slides.
I'll just follow that suggestion oops yeah so the suggestion was to uh try W as minus 2 and B.
as 2 right so I'll just start that I'll just try that okay so I'll set this to -2 I'll.
set this to 2. okay so this is where I'm going to start now and now you can see that.
it's a slightly favorable point because I'm on a slope I'm not in a flat surface I am on a.
