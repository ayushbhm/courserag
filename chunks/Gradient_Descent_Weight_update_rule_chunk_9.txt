principled way of moving in the WB plane we are no longer doing our guesswork we know that if we.
do we just saw a proof or we arrived with the formula mathematically that if we keep moving in the.
direction opposite to the gradient we are guaranteed that the loss at every step will uh decrease not that it.
will just decrease it will also decrease by uh the largest amount right now one thing you should have noticed.
on the previous slide in my last update actually you could go back and check whether the loss had increased.
or not and if the loss had increased what could have been the reason for that and the answer there.
is that the learning rate or the ETA was quite high but all of these are things that we'll come.
back to so don't worry about okay so this is the algorithm that we have created uh we'll start at.
time step 0. we'll set up some Max iterations we'll initialize W and B randomly and well while we are.
