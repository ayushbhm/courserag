right because you compute the expectation and then that's a constant so that will come out so you have e.
x y minus mu Y into e of X but again your V of X because X is Sigma is.
going to be 0 so your ah what you remain with is e of X comma y right so in.
this case when Epsilon was a random variable with mean 0 this product between treating Epsilon as X and this.
quantity as Y is actually the covariance between these two random variables right so that's that's something that we are.
noting now how do we use this fact what do we do with this is something that we will see.
on the next line right so so far ah so good uh we were interested in this we cannot estimate.
this so we extract estimated this as a sum of these three quantities of which the first two we know.
how to deal with the third one is still not clear right because it again has f of x so.
we need to see if we can somehow get rid of this third quantity or make some comment on that.
