realize it wouldn't be a good choice because the logistic function i know is going to clamp all my outputs.
between zero to one right so the logistic function as we had seen is something like this right so it.
the output goes just from zero to one right so no matter what the input is my outputs are going.
to lie between 0 to 1 right now why is that not good here because here i know that the.
ratings are on a scale of 0 to 10 in fact they could also be on a scale of 0.
to 100 so then if i choose the output as sigmoid function then my network is always going to predict.
values between zero to one whereas my true values are between zero to ten or zero to hundred and then.
that doesn't make sense right so i need to predict be able to predict uh unbounded values or values having.
a much higher range than zero to one right so that's what the constraint that i have and in such.
cases when your output is going to be a real value right and not just bounded between zero to one.
