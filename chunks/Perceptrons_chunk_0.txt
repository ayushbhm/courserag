[Music] so let's begin the next module which is on uh perceptrons right and uh just again talk about the.
story uh so far and the story ahead right so so the one question which i asked is like what.
about non-boolean inputs right so we have so far been focusing on the case where the inputs are only boolean.
so we'll have to see what happens if the boolean inputs are not boolean then the second is in this.
toy example is the boolean functions that we are looking at so far we were just hand coding the threshold.
i gave you the example of the and function then asked you what should the threshold be and you are.
able to quickly calculate uh in your head of course you're doing some calculations in that case it's not hand.
coded but it's just like you worked it out by hand and you arrive at a solution but do we.
always have to do that is it like won't it become cumbersome in complex cases then the other more i.
