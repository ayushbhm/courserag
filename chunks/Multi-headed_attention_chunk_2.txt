you get you get a Z1 you get Z1 Z2 all the way up to ZT right so this is.
what we had seen uh when we ended the last lecture now this is called one head so what what.
I mean by a head here so this is a one such unit which takes the inputs H1 to H2.
and gives you the elements Z1 to Z2 right or the refined representation Z1 to ZT which also take care.
of the contextual information because they depend on the key they depend on the value and they depend on the.
query right so they take care of the contextual information now you could have one more such block right so.
you could have the same block repeated so let me just call this z11z21 and z uh one t right.
so this is the output of the first attention head similarly you could have the same block repeated where you.
have another set of parameters right so let me just call these uh W1 right these are the first set.
of eight matrices you have similarly you could have another's repeated block right and let me just show it on.
