now let me just hide the other ones I'll reset everything and just show you HD one so this is.
looking like a tar function now right so this is the kind of tower that I wanted it's not a.
perfect Tower but it's also because my two functions did not become completely step function if I make W's very.
high then you can see that it will become closer and closer to a tower function right it'll start looking.
like an Impulse right and I could increase B to increase the width of the track so now it's looking.
more and more like a tower function so I've got my tower maker what is my tower maker take one.
sigmoid neuron take another sigmoid neuron set the W is very high right if you set the W is very.
high then you recover the step function and then what you are essentially doing let me just show that also.
let me reset and show this one how did you get the tower because you are doing the red function.
