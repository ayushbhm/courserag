is true I'm going to do something similar here right and whatever I'm going to do here is based on.
this excellent illustration right this link that you see in the bottom which is an online textbook one of the.
very earlier early online textbooks on deep learning and it has a very good uh Tech stand and accompanying illustration.
explaining whatever I'm going to do explain on the slide so all the material that I have presenting here the.
ideas are borrowed from there right so uh just wanted to acknowledge that as well as point you to that.
okay so so this is what an arbitrary function looks like right so I have my input X I'm dealing.
with so this is the x axis and this is my f of x r y axis right and you.
can see that I have a very arbitrary looking function right it's maybe I I it's not a sine X.
it's not a cosine X it's maybe a mixture of some of these functions right uh it's not x square.
