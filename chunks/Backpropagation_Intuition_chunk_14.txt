these intermediate guys find out each of their responsibility and then find using those computations find the responsibility of the.
weight that you're interested in right now where did this jump happen right so it's still this point i was.
only talking english and then suddenly i introduced this math part i suddenly came to partial derivatives right so how.
did i make that jump why i want to know what is the responsibility of these guys so how did.
that responsibility became derivative what does the derivative tell us the derivative tells us is that if i change w.
a bit how much does the loss change right so if changing w a very tiny bit changes the loss.
of makes a large change to the loss that means w has a very strong influence on the loss w.
is more responsible for the loss if i change the w a small amount maybe the loss will decrease a.
lot right hence derivative or partial derivatives is a good way of assigning responsibility to the weights for the loss.
