Computing a refined representation of a Z1 you will set all the other Alphas to zero right similarly so this.
I should call as alpha 1 J so this is Alpha 1 1 Alpha 1 2 Alpha One three now.
similarly when you're Computing the defined representation for Z2 your equation would be Alpha to J into v j and.
again Alpha 2 1 Alpha 2 2 Alpha 2 3 is what you care about and all the other Alphas.
you will set to zero right so that all that's all that masking does right now the question would be.
that what happens to Z4 right so I will I'm going to compute Z4 right Z4 would also have a.
formula so in that formula what do I do right so you you will again have only these Alphas ready.
in that formula all the other Alphas would not be of use but actually it doesn't matter right because again.
when you are doing so the key thing to realize here is that these did not participate in the computation.
right these gave you the uh corresponding q k and V but when it was time to use those V's.
