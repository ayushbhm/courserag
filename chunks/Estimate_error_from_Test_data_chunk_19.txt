actually very close to the empirical test error so if this is what your estimate is going to be then.
you are not making a very ah large gap right because there is just plus a small constant right that.
is what we derived here because it was the sum of this quantity plus this quantity plus this quantity we.
proved that this quantity is 0 this is a small constant so if I were to expect if if I.
were to estimate the true error using the test data then my uh exp my up my estimation is actually.
very good right so if I compute the error from the test data then I'm actually very close to the.
true error right ah now let's see what happens if we had to estimate the error from the training data.
so that's why whenever you want to estimate the model so now you have trained the model and you want.
to see how good the model is it does not make sense as I'll show soon to estimate it from.
