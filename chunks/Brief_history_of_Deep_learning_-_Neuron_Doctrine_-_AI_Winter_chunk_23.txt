winter of ai where the interest in funding large scale projects in ai started declining and people started i would.
say rationalizing their expectations from ai a bit more right but that does not mean that work completely stopped no.
one was doing uh yeah there was still work happening and small progress was being made in different uh areas.
right in particular in 1986 uh yeah so as i said this was the ai winter of connectionism and for.
some of you are initiated in this there's connexious ti and there's a symbolic ai so people were still interested.
in symbolic ai but lost interest in what is known as connectionist ai whereas today's ai is largely dominated by.
connectionist ai and we want to again try to see if you can come up with hybrid models because again.
today people are realizing that this way of doing ai the deep learning view of ai has its limitations and.
we need to start looking at hybrid methods or complete different alternatives to really push the frontier a bit more.
