to happen so both VT and UT are increasing right because both are accumulating gradients but because of this one.
time step delay between them right one is U T minus one the other is VT so in the Steep.
regions while both are growing UT is growing slightly slower than VT and hence the effective learning rate is going.
to be smaller right now yeah that's always same here whereas in the RMS prop the effective learning rate would.
just have been ETA by VT and hence there is no adoption Happening Here Right okay so this is all.
that I've already said you could just read what there's on the slide now let's see what happens in the.
flat regions okay so now I'm in the flat region so this is some Delta w i right at the.
ith time step I am trying to take the gradient now what will happen here right so now if I.
look at uh U T minus 1 and VT okay now U T minus 1 remember is one time step.
behind a VT so then one way of looking at it is that in ut minus 1 these all are.
