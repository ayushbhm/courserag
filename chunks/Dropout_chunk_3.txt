in Dropout is that you have this original Network which I have shown on the left hand side you drop.
out some units from it that means you drop out some new neurons from it so this is I've dropped.
on some randomly some six neurons from here and then you get a different network right so you have got.
a different architecture now right so just as an option one uh you are training neural networks with different architectures.
and you are training key of those I have got the same effect here by dropping some neurons so it.
had the base architecture I dropped some neurons and I now my neural network looks a bit different right and.
just doing it temporarily just for that current training instance I'm going to drop a few neurons or that batch.
a mini batch I'm going to drop a few neurons right and then again do something different in the next.
device right now each node is retained with some fixed probability right so every uh so every time I get.
