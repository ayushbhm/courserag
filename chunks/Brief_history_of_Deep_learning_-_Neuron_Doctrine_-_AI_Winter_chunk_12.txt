just said that a neuron a model of the brain would be that there are multiple inputs coming to it.
right and these could be inputs from a sensory organs and based on that it takes a decision and a.
very simplified model is where all these inputs are binary and the decision is also binary so i take inputs.
like uh is it raining outside do i have money do i have time and if so maybe i'll go.
out to watch a movie right so that's how the decision uh making processes modeled with a very simplified model.
right and then this again got modified and this perceptron model was proposed by frank rosenblatt and this is what.
he had to say about it when he proposed it and if you look at the diagram of course the.
perceptron model is again something that we'll do in detail in the course uh you'll see that it's very similar.
to the earlier diagram except you see some weights here right so now these different decision factors have some weight.
