had in the last class where f hat is your approximation and now instead of telling you what f hat.
is i've just given you a diagram where is the f hat in this diagram right so that's something that.
we should try to figure out right what does the f hat look like and that should give you confidence.
that this is just yet another choice of function families within the machine learning paradigm where you could choose different.
functions you could choose the linear function quadratic function and this is yet another function it just happens to be.
a very complex composite function but you can still write down what f hat is right so we will try.
to do that so i'll go back to that setting of a typical machine learning supervised machine learning setup where.
you have data which comprises of x's and y's so that is there i have the x i have the.
y's and i want to now come up with a model okay which is my approximation of the result of.
