what is happening is that you have these multiple sub models each sub model is getting sampled rarely right because.
there are an exponentially High number of sub models so each sub model is getting sampled rarely so each sub.
model is not getting the chance to overfit on specific portions of the data because hardly it will see the.
data once I mean forget about seeing it twice it may not even see it once right so this kind.
of uh phenomenon which happens in model averaging or in bagging where the each model gets each sub model or.
each different model gets a chance to overfit on the training data Dropout does not really get that chance right.
so now uh in the case of bagging the model is getting to update the weights again and again on.
the same training sample but in the case of Dropout it's not getting that chance so whenever it sees a.
sample we should try to do a larger update right because this if this data point is sensitive we should.
