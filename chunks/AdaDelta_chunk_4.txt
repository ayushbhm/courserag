difference is something that we'll see but the main thing to note is that we are only taking a fraction.
of the update that we have made and this update that we had made was uh a function of this.
Delta WT that we had right the gradient that we had okay so uh don't worry I will just clear.
these things in the next couple of slides yeah so now suppose you are in a high curvature region right.
so you are in a steep region and what do you want in the Steep region you want the effective.
learning rate to be small okay so at time step 0 your V 0 so your you can refer to.
the equations here the equations for VT uh UT and all of that I'll just not bother too much about.
referring to them again and again but these computations are according to these equations right so at any point you're.
confused you can just pause and verify that we have used the same equations right so V 0 is going.
to be point one into Delta W 0 squares then you will have the sorry nabla W zero square and.
