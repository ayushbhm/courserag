just reuse that i don't need to compute the whole of it again and then i just need to compute.
this red quantity right so that's the idea that we are going to use in back propagation that we'll have.
these long chains and that would make the task daunting but then we'll argue that some portions of this chain.
we have already computed and we're just going to recompute reuse them right so it's not as daunting as as.
it seems right and now some of you could realize that if there were like multiple weights here and if.
this part of the chain was already computed then maybe for all those weights you could reuse that computation right.
if it's not clear at this point don't worry this all will become clear as we keep discussing the back.
propagation algorithm but that's the intuition that i want at least on this slide whatever is there this you should.
understand that i had this big blue part but if i had already computed that then i can just reuse.
