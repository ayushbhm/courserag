it's like every network is getting trained because even if this network was never sampled there were other networks which.
got sampled in which these weights would have been active and hence those weights were getting regular updates right and.
since every uh weight is going to be present with an 80 probability because you are going to retain 80.
percent with probability 80 percent you're going to retain a node right and also okay so 80 into 80 because.
both these nodes need to be remained so with 80 probability this will be retained and with 80 probability this.
will be retained so with 64 probability both will be retained and hence this way it would be retained right.
so every weight with 64 probability it will be retained right and hence it will get updated many times it.
will get 64 percent of the times that you are doing training it will get updates if you run for.
a thousand steps every weight will get updated around 640 different uh times right at least 640 times okay so.
