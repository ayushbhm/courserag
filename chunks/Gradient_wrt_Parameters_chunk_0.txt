foreign [Music] with respect to the parameters where are we we finished this part then we finished this part we.
don't care how many hidden layers are there we'll just keep applying the same formula again and again so we.
are done with this very nasty part which could have repetitions there could be many hidden layers and now we.
are finally ready to compute this okay so let's go there okay uh so let's look at that right so.
what do we want now we want the derivative of the loss function with respect to one of the weight.
matrices right w k and I want this to be again generic I don't it should not the formula I.
need not have to recompute the formula for W1 W2 W3 I should just be able to do it for.
a generic uh WK that's what I'm interested in and again my recipe is going to be the same instead.
of computing this uh gradient at one go right so this is the derivative of a scalar with respect to.
