the current values of w and B this is how bad my uh approximation was right this is how bad.
my current sigmoid function is it gives me a loss of 0.099 now once I had handled for this loss.
I knew that I should keep trying to adjust the weights so that this loss decreases and I did that.
by some doing a guesswork at every Point slide guesswork slight smart guesswork I was seeing okay this brought it.
closer so maybe further move W in that direction this took it far so maybe let's not move W in.
that direction but maybe uh make it in the other direction right and here the two directions are like either.
increase W or decrease W right move it positive or move it negative and we are able to come up.
with the sigmoid function right now what we wanted is something better than the guesswork algorithm right so then we.
said that what you're trying to do is take every stage you're doing this random movements and trying to make.
