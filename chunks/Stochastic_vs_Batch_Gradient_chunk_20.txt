lines of code corresponding to update because after every data point you will make the update right and similarly for.
nestro which I'll not show you the code for that I think it's straightforward so now let's look at uh.
on this slide I think this is written as gradient descent and SGD but this is the momentum based versions.
of both the stochastic momentum based gradient descent and the vanilla momentum based gradient descent okay so let's see how.
it goes so you can see that in addition to the oscillations that you have right and this was quite.
a complex uh surface right because it had some steep slopes remember from the Contour discussion that when you see.
the lines are very close to each other the slope is a bit Steep and we know that there is.
a problem in steep slopes so the green curve was going here and there because uh not is the true.
momentum based gradient descendant so you are taking the derivative or you're taking Computing the gradient from all the points.
