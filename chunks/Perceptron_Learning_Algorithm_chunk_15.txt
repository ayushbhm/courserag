points lying in the positive half space satisfy this expression this inequality that's why the angle is going to be.
less than 90 degrees and because the points lying in the negative half space satisfy this inequality that's why the.
angle is going to be less than 90 degrees so you just don't know this pictorially now you also know.
that it follows from this inequality right so all positive points will have a acute angle all positive negative points.
will have an angle which is greater than 90 degrees right so now with this explanation in mind let's revisit.
the algorithm and let's try to see what is happening right so what was i doing if i had a.
positive point on which i was making an error then i was changing the weight vector by adding the point.
to the weight vector and that's what is happening if i had a positive point on which i was making.
an error then i was changing the weight vector by adding the point to it right so let's see what.
