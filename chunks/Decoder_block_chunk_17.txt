light of whatever you had seen in the encoder right so now you want to take S1 as the input.
you want to generate a q1 from that okay then using q1 and these K1 K2 up to K capital.
T where capital T was the number of tokens in the uh encoder right you will compute the corresponding Alphas.
right so you'll have alpha 1 1 Alpha 1 2 Alpha One T so these Alphas tell you how much.
attention should you give to the ith input in the encoder while Computing a refined representation for the jth decoder.
value right and now using this you will compute your Z1 as whatever Alphas you have computed Alpha 1j into.
the values which are coming out of here right so these are going to be some VJs and you're going.
to sum over J equal to 1 to T right the same computation happens again you have the key query.
and value it's just that now the attention is between the encoder the decoder representation and the encoder representation and.
