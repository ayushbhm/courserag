some derivatives so I have just a set set of steps which you can uh which one step follows from.
the previous and you could just go back and look at this if you have any doubts but there's nothing.
conceptually difficult that I've done here okay now uh from here let's uh now look at this loss right this.
is our regularized loss and the derivative of the regularized loss as we had derived on the previous slide was.
this plus Alpha W right this we are derived so remember LW is equal to L W plus Alpha by.
2 W transpose W now if you take the derivative of this with respect to W so here this derivative.
all of these are derivatives with respect to W it's obvious from the context so I have not suffixed it.
explicitly but it's derivative with respect to w uh and so this would just be derivative of this quantity plus.
the derivative of this quantity and the derivative of this quantity as we saw on the previous slide was just.
