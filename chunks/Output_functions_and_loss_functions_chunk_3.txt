squared error loss function right so you have three values that you're predicting for each of these values you calculate.
the square of the difference between the true value and the predicted value you sum it over all the n.
training examples that you have and then take the mean or the average so this is the mean squared error.
that you would compute so this we have already seen it when you're trying to predict real values it's best.
to take the squared error loss because it computes the deviation between the true value and the captured value right.
now a related question here should be what should the output function be right so you have the output function.
sitting here right so this dark green guy is the output right and i'm taking a3 and i'm going to.
pass it through some output function and that is going to give me uh the output y hat which is.
shown as the dark or the shaded green part here right so what should my output function be right so.
