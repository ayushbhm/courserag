and it has many layers let me just delete this and then do it again yes so here you have.
the retinas as you're saying this interacts with the outside world and it will be like it's the input that.
you are receiving right and then this input as you can follow the arrows it will pass through different layers.
in the brain right and each layer might do some amount of processing and then pass it on to the.
other layer so you can process the flow and then finally after going through several layers you can follow the.
arrows that you have here it finally generates some action and this goes to the spinal cord and in this.
case it might just be to move the hand right you're seeing something in response to which you want to.
move your hand right so that's how information gets processed across multiple layers and now i'll focus on these red.
parts here right which are labeled as v1 v2 uh v4 right and i'll tell you a bit about uh.
