few examples of examples on the previous slide where some stickers were added to the sign or some random patterns.
were generated and now uh the models this this repository allows you to benchmark the models on such adversarial examples.
and if they don't do well then you know that they're not really learning to solve the problem but are.
somewhat like clever hands where they are relying on some other cues to arrive at the right answers without really.
understanding what is the question being asked right and then there are now several workshops on blackbox nlp where the.
focus is on analyzing and interpreting the neural networks which are used for nlp and there's this nice uh textbook.
interpretable machine learning a guide for making black box models explainable right so the reason i'm bringing up all this.
is that this was not so much in focus a few years back right but now this has become quite.
