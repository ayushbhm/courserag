is this quantity this is L Dash W naught L Dash W naught is nothing but the first order derivative.
of the loss function W minus W naught is actually the Delta between that right now what is happening here.
all this looks very confusing to me so let's just try to draw a line here so what am I.
doing here right I am the actual function has a curve right it's some it's definitely not a linear function.
right but I'm approximating that function by a linear function I am saying that in this small neighborhood here right.
say from this is the small neighborhood in this small neighborhood I'm going to assume that the function is linear.
right now if the function is linear that means I have assumed that the function is of the form Y.
is equal to MX plus C okay and I already know y naught which is MX naught plus C right.
I already know that right and what is uh m m is simply the slope and the slope is just.
