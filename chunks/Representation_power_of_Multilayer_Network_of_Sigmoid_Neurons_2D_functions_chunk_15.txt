guy was 1 but the cn guy was 0. so if i add 1 plus 0 i'll again get 1.
here right same argument for this region where the cn guy was 1 but the purple guy is 0 so.
i'll add them i'll get 0. same argument for this region and same argument for this region does that make.
sense now for this region in the middle both the cyan and the purple are one so if i add.
them i'll get a 2 which i'll get an elevation there and that's exactly what is happening when i show.
you the sum of these two right so in all these regions you can now see it yeah i think.
this is a good view uh i'll just stop it so in these regions it's zero in these regions it's.
one in these four regions and in this region it's two right so i've got my tower actually my tower.
is sitting here on the top of the structure this is the tower that i'm interested in but i have.
these some extra scaffoldings here and there which i want to get rid of right so now how do i.
