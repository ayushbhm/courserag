lecture like a few years back uh lecture slides from Andre carpathy's course I'm not sure if that those videos.
are still available but they were available a few years back and I had taken material from there so Let's.
uh let's start with the sigmoid function so sigmoid is given by this Sigma of X is equal to 1.
over 1 plus e raised to minus X and this is what it looks like it is between 0 and.
1. so whatever input you pass it in our case uh the input that we passed to uh the sigmoid.
function is sum a which in turn is some linear transformation of the previous layer right we pass some Ai.
and it is some linear transformation of the previous layer right that's what our input is going to be and.
whatever is the input that applies element wise on this Vector a and it just squishes it or compresses it.
between 0 to 1 right so we already have seen this in the past uh so now since we are.
