sides i want a closed tower right just as that 2d thing where you had a tower like this i'd.
want a tower which is closed from all the four sides right now right now it's open from two sides.
and that's where i had this discussion on what happens with the orientation right so you could have you could.
see that one of the weights controls the movement in one direction and the other weight controls the movement in.
the other direction right so right now is adjusting one of the weights right you can see here that w1.
and w3 is what i have played with i have kept w2 and w4 as zero right and w2 and.
w4 would help me move in this direction so it will probably form a block which would be in this.
direction so it will bring in the remaining two walls i already have two walls for the tower i'm looking.
for two more walls and all of this will become clear when i show you the illustration on the next.
