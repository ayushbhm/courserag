you could also have some real valued inputs like the imdb rating the critics rating of the movie and so.
on right so all of these inputs are feeding into our perceptron and there are also weights associated with them.
it's just that we don't know what these weights are and we want to learn these weights such that once.
we learn these weights then for any given new input it should allow us to make that decision right and.
we should be able to learn these weights in such a way that at least for the given data and.
we'll assume that the data is linearly separable so whatever m data points that are given to us we will.
assume that they are linearly separable that means you can draw a line or a plane or a hyper plane.
such that all the points for which the output should be positive are in the one half space and all.
the points for which the output should be negative or in the other half space right so we will assume.
