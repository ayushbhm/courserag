these three vectors to participate in this equation right so you have these three vectors participating in the equation but.
now you just have h i and H J so where do you get these three vectors from right how.
do you generate these three vectors that's the question and that's what uh one of the uh Innovations are one.
of the uh equations proposed in the case of Transformer based models how do you get these three vectors uh.
from these two uh word embeddings so that's the idea so what we'll do is we'll use this Matrix transformation.
and that's not surprising because anyways in the case of the original equation also you had this linear transformation right.
and now from each Vector I want to be able to generate these three uh vectors so I'll use three.
linear Transformations right and they call them specifically as key query and value vectors and the corresponding matrices as the.
key Matrix the query Matrix and the value Matrix right so that's what we'll do on the next slide.
