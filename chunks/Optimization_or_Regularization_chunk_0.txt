foreign [Music] so first let's see people who try to hint that this is perhaps due to better optimization right.
so what is optimization problem that we're trying to solve this is the problem optimization problem we are trying to.
reduce the mean squared error so what is the optimization problem that we're trying to solve this is the problem.
optimization problem we are trying to reduce the mean square error cross into velocity whatever on the training data right.
uh is it the case that in the absence of unsupervised pre-training this problem itself is hard you cannot really.
reduce L Theta to zero but now once you do unsupervised pre-training L Theta is able to reduce to zero.
hence earlier you had poor optimization but now you have better optimization right so let us see this right so.
the error surface as I said for a deep neural network is highly non-connection it has these many plateaus many.
