parts here right which are labeled as v1 v2 uh v4 right and i'll tell you a bit about uh.
what they do right again a very simplified uh explanation of what they try to do right so here layer.
one might just be responsible for detecting edges and corners so i'm looking at people sitting in front of me.
and this layer might just tell me okay there are some dots there are some edges and that's all that's.
all the information it will process i'll pass on this information to the next layer and this next layer might.
now start looking at this information in a more organized or grouped manner that there are feature groups or these.
two edges together seem to form a nose these two edges together seem to form eyes and these two sorry.
these two edges form a mouth and these two dots were actually eyes and the next layer might again look.
at bigger objects coming out from these smaller groups here all of these combine to make a face actually right.
