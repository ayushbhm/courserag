let's assume your inputs were say binary for the sake of simplicity right now what you do is you add.
a noise process such that for every input say with probability 80 percent it will keep the input as it.
is and with probability 20 percent it will flip the input right that is a very simple noise process so.
if you have like 100 uh digits as input or an input belongs to R 100 or in this case.
uh 0 comma 1 raised to 100 because there are only binary inputs then uh with probability eighty percent it.
will keep each of those hundred values as they were and with probability 20 it will flip it so in.
effect what you would expect is that twenty percent of your inputs has been corrupted right because twenty percent of.
it will get a change right so now you have added noise to the input and now once you have.
added noise to the input what is a deep neural network good at it is good at mapping x to.
