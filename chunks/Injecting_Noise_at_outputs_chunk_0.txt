foreign [Music] technique that we are going to look at is adding noise to the outputs so we saw adding.
noise to the inputs but you could also add noise to the output so let's see how what that means.
so this is what your output is right so you are given a certain image so let's look at the.
classification problem and this is what your true Y is going to look like all the probability masses on the.
correct level which is 2 in this case so 0 1 2 all the way up to 9 and everything.
else is 0 right and now this is what your true Y is and you are trying to predict uh.
y hat or f x ah F hat of X which is very close to this 2 y right and.
that could lead to overfitting because if you have you if you have a lot of parameters you know that.
this error you can drive down to zero but now what if I do the following right so I instead.
of using this output the true output that was given to me uh and this is what my loss this.
