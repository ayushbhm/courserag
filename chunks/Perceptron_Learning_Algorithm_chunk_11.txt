1 x 1 right plus w 2 x 2 plus w naught equal to zero so this is the equation.
of a line which is analogous to this equation that i have and all i am saying is that any.
point which lies on this line satisfies this equation and that's a trivial statement to me now what can you.
tell us about the angle between any such point right and the vector w so first of all we have.
to again realize that both x and w are vectors and that's exact precisely what is defined here so now.
i can ask this question and i am saying that any point which lies on the slice satisfies this equation.
so then if it satisfies this equation what can you say about the angle between the point and the vector.
w if it satisfies the equation w transpose equal to zero that means these two vectors are orthogonal we know.
that from linear algebra so the angle is going to be 90 degrees right and because we know that cos.
of the angle is equal to this formula and if w transpose x is 0 so the cos of the.
