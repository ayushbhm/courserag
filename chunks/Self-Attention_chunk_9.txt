this V getting multiplied by everything that was happening inside is here this VA transpose damage into something something and.
this is where St minus 1 and H J were so they were participating in Computing this and finally you.
get a vector and then you multiply it by this right so similarly now the VJs here are participating uh.
in the final computing station that you have right so Z1 is going to be computed this way now how.
do you compute Z2 the same story everything Remains the Same right so now you would have Q2 as the.
query right so your e2s would be the dot product between all the Q2 and all the vectors then you.
will compute the alphas as the soft Max once you have computed the alphas these are all Alpha twos you.
will compute the Z as a weighted sum of your Phi input vectors and the weights would come from the.
alpha right so very easy to understand now you had one vector you had H1 to H5 from each of.
