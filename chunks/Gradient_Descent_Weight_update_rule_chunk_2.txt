enter that in this uh box here right so 1.2 minus 0.31 is going to be 0.89 okay so this.
is where I end up right so I have moved and looks like I have moved in a good direction.
because I'm headed towards one of the Minima right uh so zero point uh now uh at this point I.
have 0.89 is my current value I've again computed a derivative and my ETA into DW is 1.25 so I'm.
again just going to ah 0.89 minus 1.25 is what I'm going to do and that would be around minus.
0.36 right so I'm going just going to set the value as minus 0.36 and this is where I get.
right so as you can see I have moved a bit away right I should have I would have liked.
to end at the Minima but now I've gone in the opposite direction right and why this is happening what.
could you do to make sure that this doesn't happen is something for all of us to figure out in.
the next couple of lectures right now just keep trying this right I've shown you what to do you just.
