see that the loss will increase right because these are probably very high learning rates and you are quickly overshooting.
the Minima and then going into high loss regions and for some learning rates it will smoothly decrease right so.
those would be the good learning rates and then suppose point one is one such good learning rate then you.
will do like a zoom in around this point wanted so maybe you can do a more linear search around.
this now so if point one was good maybe try point zero five maybe try point two point three right.
so all of this is of course just heuristics right there's no clear winner strategy here but what you need.
to take away from this slide is that it might happen that you just set the learning rate to some.
value and you see that your algorithm is not converging your loss keeps increasing then you will have to kind.
of experiment a bit around it and this is a good way of experiment you just try a few different.
