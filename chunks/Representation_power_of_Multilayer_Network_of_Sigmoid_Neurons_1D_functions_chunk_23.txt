let me reset and show this one how did you get the tower because you are doing the red function.
uh minus the blue function right that's what you were doing red minus blue is what you are doing right.
so now at this point both are zero here both are zero so all of this will remain zero you.
are doing 0 minus 0 right at this point both are 1 right so again from this point onwards you.
will get 1 minus 1 which is 0 right and in this region the red curve is one but the.
blue curve is zero so in this region you will get 1 minus 0 which is one so hence you.
will get a tower like that right so that's the reason you are getting that topper function right I'll just.
redraw it right so this is the reason you got the tower function okay so that's why we have set.
it up it way so now I've got a network which can produce a tower function and not just any.
network it uses my sigmoid neurons I just have to set the W's to a high value and I can.
