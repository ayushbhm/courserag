so only these two red points uh which are 0 1 and 0 0 have actually been ah are in.
the right place right they are in the negative half space and they should be in the negative half space.
but the other two points I am making so what is happening here is that as I'm changing the value.
of w and W 2 the error or the number of Errors is changing right so now I can think.
of error itself why is this not working yeah I can think of error as a function of w 1.
W 2 because I have fixed W naught right and depending on the values of w 1 W 2 y.
that I try the error is changing so now I think of error as a function of W1 W2 and.
now once you have digested that idea we are ready for the next slide where I have error which is.
on the Z axis okay as a function of let me just try to see if I can zoom into.
this yeah so error is a function of W1 and W 2 right so this is my W1 this is.
my W2 and along the Z axis I am plotting the error and what are the values that the error.
