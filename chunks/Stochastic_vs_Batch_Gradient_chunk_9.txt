heads is so a thousand may have been okay right similarly what you could do is that waiting for all.
the million data points to get over before you make update is bad making an update after one data point.
is also bad but some there in between maybe making an update after looking at 100 data points right so.
instead of computing the average as 1 by n summation I equal to 1 by n and then the loss.
value right instead of that maybe instead of using n equal to 1 million or all the training points I.
could use n equal to 100 and that might give me a fair approximation right so that's the idea that.
we'll head towards so while one approximating from one point really looks bad we need not do that that's only.
for illustrating uh the concept right so I'll do that and once you do that whether you approximate from one.
point ten point or 100 points as long as you're not using all the data points you are in trouble.
