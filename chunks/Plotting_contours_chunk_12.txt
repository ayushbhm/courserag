lines is high but as I keep coming down the slope becomes sharp and my distance between the contour lines.
decreases right and same thing you can see everywhere right wherever the slope is sharp you will see that the.
distance between the contour lines is smaller now this entire gradient descent algorithm now I could just visualize it on.
the contour map itself right and here you have both in Parable so these are the two views that we.
have the 3D surface and its contour map at the bottom then the contour map and what happens actually to.
the sigmoid function right so let's try to look at both this views and get comfortable with them right so.
just as the point was moving on the 3D loss surface you can also show the point moving on the.
2D surface so now I just have the WB plane and I can now I can see how the loss.
function is imposed on the WB plane right because I can draw the contour map and the contour map gives.
