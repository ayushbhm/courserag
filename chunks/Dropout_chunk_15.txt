a thousand steps every weight will get updated around 640 different uh times right at least 640 times okay so.
now what do you do at test time this is what you are doing at training time at training time.
every node was present only with probability P right now what do you do at test time at test time.
now again you cannot sample these two raised to n networks past the output through all of those and then.
take the final decision right so at test time you can use this neat trick which is saying that hey.
every node was only present with probability P that means it was only present P faction of the times right.
so that's let's say 80 percent of the times or sixty percent of times whatever is the probability that you.
have chosen right so then I should trust the output of this node with only that fraction this guy only.
participated in 80 of the discussions so whatever it says I only trust it with 80 value that's the same.
