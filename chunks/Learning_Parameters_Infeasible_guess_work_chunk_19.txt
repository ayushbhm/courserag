more favorable right and you can see that the loss has also decreased right but since i was randomly guessing.
i did not have this error surface in front of me so i just continued randomly right and then i.
went to the point minus 0.1 comma 0 okay and i goofed up you can see that i actually went.
up on the error surfaces i was somewhere um yeah it was somewhere here and i climbed up on the.
error surface right and then i changed it further so what i did is oops yeah then i changed it.
to a 0.94 and minus 0.94 and then the loss decreased right and i can see from the sigmoid function.
also that i am going in the right direction and then i kept in continuing in this direction but you.
can see that my movements if you look at the wb plane they're very random that is jumping from one.
point to another i'm just getting lucky somewhere and i once i hit this point 0.94 minus 0.94 then i.
get a sense of what is required i need to increase the w's and decrease the b's and then i.
