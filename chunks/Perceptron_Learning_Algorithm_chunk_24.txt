angle right so this greedy step has worked in doing whatever it was said to do right so it has.
reduced the angle now let me do it again right so now again randomly pick a point and say this.
time the point that i pick is p2 okay so i'll compute the angle between sorry i'll just compute the.
dot product w transpose x and again i am seeing that the uh [Music] sorry yeah this is where i.
was so i picked the point p 2 and again you can see with this w the angle is still.
greater than 0 right sorry greater than 90 degrees so i don't want that so i'll have to apply a.
correction here also what will the correction be i'll add p2 to w and i'll get a new w so.
this is what my new w looks like and you can again see that the angle has decreased in fact.
here it has already become less than 90 but i don't care about it all i care about is the.
angle is decreased now let me pick up another point and this time maybe i picked up n1 right and.
