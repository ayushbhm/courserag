2 w t plus 1 right so this would be w t plus 1 corresponding to Eta 1 another WT.
plus 1 corresponding to ETA two and so on so now we have found a new value for weight and.
not just one new value you have found a bunch of new values each corresponding to a particular ETA now.
plug in all these values in the loss function right so all of these values you could plug in into.
the loss function all the different W's that you have computed and now whichever W gives you the minimum loss.
you pick that up so what you have done effectively is that you have tried different learning rates and you.
have made an update so you got a bunch of updated values now you're looking at each of those values.
and Computing the loss and whichever update to updated value gives the minimum loss you're retaining that and throwing away.
all of that and then again doing the same in the next iteration so the derivative only gets computed once.
