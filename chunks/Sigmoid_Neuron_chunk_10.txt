was the pressure what was the density what was the temperature what was the marine diversity all I know right.
so what I want is a network such that when I feed any of these X's to the network the.
Y predicted by the network should be very close to the Y that I actually have right so that is.
what our Quest is going to be I'm just defining the problem I'm not telling you a solution at all.
right I'm just just about what the story ahead is going to be okay so let's move ahead from here.
uh I better delete a few of these things so before answering the above question right we'll first have to.
graduate from perceptrons to sigmoid neurons right so that's the first thing that we're going to do so uh recall.
that when we are dealing with perceptrons a perceptrons fires when the weighted sum of its input is greater than.
the threshold right unless we had this thing that Theta is equal to minus W naught right because we move.
