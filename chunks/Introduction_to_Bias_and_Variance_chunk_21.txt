for the green curve as well as the for the simple model which is the green line and for the.
complex model which is the blue curve right and now I can define a quantity called bias which is the.
difference between the average value and the True Value right so it's for the simple model its difference between the.
Green curve or the green line and the red curve right and how do I compute that difference I can.
just compute it by summing it up over all the points right so for every Point Let's assume you just.
have 100 points on this axis then for all the hundred points I can compute what the average value is.
going to be right that is the green value minus the red value and the square of that right so.
that is what my ah average error is going to be but what I am defining as the bias is.
that whatever is the average value right that divided by sorry that minus the True Value right so that's what.
