you increase and then again restart right so that's what capital t is and so let's see what happens so.
this is what it looks like right so it you have is you start with a high value and then.
it keeps decreasing and when it reaches this interval this interval here is 50. so when it reaches the 50.
and you can substitute these values that you can substitute 50 here and you substitute 50 and substitute here so.
you if you compute these values right so T mod 50 plus 1 would be T mod sorry 50 mod.
51 which is going to be uh 50 and then divided by 50 so this quantity will just become 1.
so we'll have COS of Pi which is going to be a minus 1 or sorry cos of Pi is.
going to be uh minus 1 and then you have 1 minus 1 so this will become 0 so we'll.
just have the minimum value here right and that's exactly what is happening here right okay and this is called.
a warm restart because from uh once you come to the minimum point you quickly jump to the maximum Point.
