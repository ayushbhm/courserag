function so let's see what will happen in this network for the xor function so when you have the input.
as 0 0 now when i say 0 0 assume minus 1 minus 1 the xor truth table says that.
the output should be 0 right now we know that h1 h2 s3 h4 the h1 will take on the.
value 1 everything else would be 0. so if i look at summation w i hi it will just be.
w 1 correct right it will be w 1 into h 1 plus w 2 into h 2 and so.
on so h 2 h 3 h 4 are 0 so the last 3 terms will be 0 and the.
first term which is w 1 will remain now if the input is 1 0 then for the xor truth.
table i know that the output should be 1. now my h1 h2 s3 h4 will take on these values.
and my output would be only w2 because my output is the summation of wi-hi now 3 terms will go.
to zero there only the w2 into h2 term will remain which will just be w2 because h2 is one.
that okay now for the next input w3 the next input w4 right now if i go back to my.
