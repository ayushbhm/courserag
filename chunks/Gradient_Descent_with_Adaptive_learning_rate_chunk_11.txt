then still my updates would have been larger right so this is one more case for having an Adaptive learning.
rate so we talked about two cases one is in the Steep regions I want the learning rate to adopt.
and in the flat regions again I wanted to increase and the Steep regions I wanted to be small the.
other cases which is again related is that if you have sparse features where you know that the when you.
compute the total derivative it's going to be very small because in most cases this x i the circled x.
i is going to be 0 and then hence my total derivative is small and if my total derivative is.
small can and I just jack up the learning rate so that my updates are a bit larger right because.
now I don't need to be conservative because anyways I'm going to get very sparse updates for this feature okay.
so that's the overall idea yeah so that's what is happening here now why is this important right so my.
