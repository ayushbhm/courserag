you have I mean you have the relu here you have the logistic sigmoid tan H everything here right and.
there are many functions here now what they observed is that any such function is composed of two operations or.
unary operation this is what unary operation is so negation of x which you see here which operates only on.
a single input is a unary operator absolute value of x which again operates on a single input is a.
unary function a into X is again a unary function or exponent of all of these are unary functions so.
what are binary functions binary functions are functions which take two inputs right so this Max of X1 comma X2.
is a binary function X1 into sigmoid or some X2 is again a binary function right so either these have.
unary so these have a combination of unary and binary uh operators so what if I tried many possible combinations.
of these unary and binary operators right these are easier to Define there's a limited space of unity operators that.
