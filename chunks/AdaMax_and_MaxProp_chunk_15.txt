naught divided by VT right and I assumed that ETA naught is equal to 1 just for the sake of.
Simplicity okay so now ETA T remains 1 in this case uh becomes one in this case now let's see.
what happens at the next time Step at the next time step my derivative was 0 right so my V1.
is just uh 0.999 times my history right so that's almost one so my effective learning rate again becomes 1.
by V T which is 1.001 so my effective learning rate has not changed much right and same for time.
Step 2 now the gradient is one right oops yeah now the derivative is one and my history was 0.999.
sorry this should have been Max of 0.999 uh multiplied by 0.99 because it is beta times VT minus 1.
but it doesn't matter the max would anyways have been one so my V2 is 1 and my learning rate.
again becomes uh 1 right so my learning rate is not changing and the same thing will keep repeating right.
the next input is 0 so again it will be 1.001 and so on right so this is what my.
