foreign [Music] I just started talking a bit about errors I was moving the line a bit and saying over.
here we're making a few errors and so on let's let's just dig a bit deeper in this concept of.
errors and I'll also introduce error surfaces which will again stay with us for a long time in the course.
right today we'll see something which is Trivial but this error surface or lost surface will keep reefers resurfacing and.
we'll see it quite often in the course at least in the initial part of the course right uh so.
again this is the example we were dealing with so now I'm looking at the uh and function now okay.
and for the and function the output should be one only for one input which is shown in green here.
and it should be 0 for the three red inputs right that's what the and function is and now my.
uh decision is of course W1 it's uh sorry yeah so it's w naught plus W1 X1 plus W 2.
x 2 greater than equal to 0 then the output would be 1 otherwise it would be zero right so.
