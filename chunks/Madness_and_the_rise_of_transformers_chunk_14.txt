these models right all of these on all of these axis we are really pushing the frontier uh quite a.
bit and then came the trillion parameter club so this is an interesting animation so you have these number of.
synapses right so uh i remember at some point uh or maybe i'll be talking about that later or i.
don't know whether i already said that so human brain i think has 10 is to 10 or maybe 10.
billion neurons right so 10 billion neurons and or maybe i'm like off by one order and then there are.
connections between these neurons those connections are called synapses and there are like 10 raise to 15 synapses in a.
human brain right so for a fruit fly it's greater than 10 raised to six for a honey bee it's.
around 10 raised to nine for mouse it is around 10 to 12 for cats 10 raised to 13 and.
for humans brains it has 10 to 15 synapses right on these synapses i would roughly equate them to the.
number of weights that are there in a neural network right if i used to if i were to take.
