able to approximate it up to the Precision of Epsilon for any of the inputs that are possible I'll pass.
it through my network I'll get a g of X and I am confident that it will not deviate from.
f of x more by Epsilon and I can construct such a network you give me an Epsilon I'll give.
you a network which will be which will produce an output which is within an Epsilon from the true output.
right and of course as you can imagine just as we had the case there that we had this exponential.
number of neurons you could imagine and we'll see that in more detail that as the Epsilon becomes smaller and.
smaller you will need a more and more powerful Network that means you need more and more neurons in this.
hidden layer this may not be obvious right away but this is something this idea is something that we will.
develop during this lecture okay so now let me just delete this and let me just put it on the.
