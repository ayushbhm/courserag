know no one has actually looked at the kind of data that you're looking at or the kind of application.
that you're looking at now how do you uh set the initial learning rate what is small what is large.
you don't know that right so that's the context in which I'm saying this but for most practical applications if.
you're working on these standard problems as I said machine translation speech recognition image recognition and so on then you.
would have something to refer to in the literature which would give you a ballpark about what the learning rate.
should be and you would follow that close right so that's the best thing to do so that's the first.
tip this tip is more for cases where you don't have anything to go by right so what you would.
do is you will try to try you try different learning rates and on a log scale right point zero.
zero zero one point zero zero one and so on right and then you will run the training for a.
