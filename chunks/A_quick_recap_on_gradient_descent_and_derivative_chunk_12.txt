value of a function in a small neighborhood around the current point so if you know the value of the.
function around the current point you could compute its value in a small neighborhood around it right so that's what.
Taylor series was allowing us to do and the key thing for us why we needed Taylor series was this.
right so we started off with some a random value for the loss function right and we wanted to find.
a sorry sorry sorry sorry we started off with some random value for the parameter and we wanted a new.
value for the parameter right so we have started somewhere we know what the loss there is now from here.
I want to move somewhere else and what is my guiding principle that wherever I move my loss should decrease.
right that means this is the condition that I was aiming for that my new loss should be less than.
the current loss right and when we solved for this uh inequality uh we made some arguments and what we.
