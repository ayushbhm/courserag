equal to 1.2 so whatever is the derivative in that formula I'm going to plug in W equal to 1.2.
and I'm going to get some answer for what the derivative is right and then my ETA is set to.
1 so that will give me what n n into derivative should be and that value is what I'll uh.
keep changing okay so let's start and I'm not going to do this in um great detail as you can.
see this is like set up as a game for you to practice and try to reach at the Minima.
so I'll just show you a few steps of how to do it so now my 1.2 is what my.
value was I have calculated the derivative and that ETA into DW turns out to be 0.31 right so I'll.
have to move in the direction oppose it to the gradient so I'll do 1.2 minus 0.31 so I'll just.
enter that in this uh box here right so 1.2 minus 0.31 is going to be 0.89 okay so this.
is where I end up right so I have moved and looks like I have moved in a good direction.
