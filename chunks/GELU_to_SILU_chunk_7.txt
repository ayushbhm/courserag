P of X taking on values less than equal to X so P of x less than equal to Infinity.
is going to be 1 right so as this approaches Infinity uh your CDF would hit one right so that's.
another function that you can use so you could make the this function Phi of X as uh take it.
as the cumulative density function uh and parameterize of of the normal uh uh distribution and then parameterized by this.
input that you have right so these are the possibilities so overall I mean I said a lot of things.
let me quickly summarize so we first do this analogy between relu and hard activation and then rewrote a value.
accordingly then we try to see that relu and Dropout seem to be doing something with this stochastic uh difference.
between them right Dropout does this stochastically withdrawal DP and minus P so why not bring that stochasticity into the.
function itself and how I brought it in I have defined a random variable M right so now this random.
