is M okay now what would that be I have written the expanded formula of a31 and I am taking.
the derivative with respect to h 2 2 so this will disappear because this does not depend on its 2y.
H22 this will also disappear this will also disappear so what will remain is w312 into H22 and the derivative.
of that with respect to H to 2 would just be w312 and what is w312 what are these indices.
3 is actually equal to I plus 1 okay one is coming from the m and this 2 is coming.
from the J right so that's why what I get w i plus 1 M J right so this is.
the mgth entry of the w i plus 1 made by tricks in this case it is the 2 comma.
2 entry of W3 okay so that's how you should read this so I hope this is clear now we'll.
move ahead so this we had already computed in the previous lecture and this we just uh proved why this.
is equal to this way so am I done here not quite yet so let's let's uh spend some more.
