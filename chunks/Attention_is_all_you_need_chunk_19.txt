compute this I need H6 and H3 which I already have I don't need to see what is happening here.
to be able to compute this function right so you already have a feeling that all these rows can be.
computed in parallel as compared to the previous case where each row dependent on the previous row right because of.
this St minus 1 that you have right so this Matrix is what I want to compute and I should.

and animal are related so the contextual similarity between them should be higher right in particular when I am Computing.
