configurations possible so suppose you have uh four uh affine Transformations within a max out neuron right so I'm talking.
about a max out neuron this is what a max out neuron looks like it has four affine Transformations and.
I'm going to take the max of those right and if those are fine Transformations happen to be these these.
are the four refined Transformations if I take the max of this then I almost can approximate the x square.
function right so it's uh it's giving me a higher degree of a non-linearity and of course it has the.
other benefits there is uh no saturation no death now because it will flow through the max path and the.
max at least one of the neurons would be great as long as it is greater than zero you would.
have some gradients flowing and for multiple affine Transformations the more you have there is a proportional increase in the.
number of parameters you could think of that as a disadvantage but there is a proof which also shows that.
