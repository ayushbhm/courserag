wt plus pi norm square right that is what this is and the norm is just the dot product of.
the vector with itself right so wt plus uh the square root of the dot product so now this would.
be wt plus pi and dot product with wt plus pi okay now again i'll just open up the brackets.
okay so i get the square of the norm of wt plus 2 times wt dot pi okay plus pi.
square and i'd assume that the pi's are normalized so the norm of pi is going to be 1 so.
i'm just going to replace that by 1 okay and i'm going to do something else also so how did.
i get from here to here because of this condition i know that w t p i is less than.
equal to 0 that's why i am here right and if that is the case then 2 times w t.
p is also going to be less than equal to 0 that means this sum is going to be less.
than or equal to this sum let me just get rid of all the marks so this sum okay has.
a quantity which is negative okay this sum does not have that quantity so it follows that this sum is.
