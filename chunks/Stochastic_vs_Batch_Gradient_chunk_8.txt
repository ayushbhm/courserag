is one as opposed to like really tossing it's a hundred or thousand or even more times and then trying.
to estimate the probability right so that's what you're doing you're almost like tossing the coin once and estimating the.
probability of heads because you're just taking one data point and estimating the derivative from that point instead of computing.
the average over a large number of data points right and as you can imagine right as what we do.
in the case of coin toss also we don't really do like we don't really need to do like a.
million coin tosses that's bad you won't be able to do that similarly just doing one coin toss is also.
bad because you cannot estimate the probability of Heads Best by doing one coin toss but somewhere in between maybe.
100 coin tosses would have been okay right and you could get a fair estimate of what the probability of.
heads is so a thousand may have been okay right similarly what you could do is that waiting for all.
