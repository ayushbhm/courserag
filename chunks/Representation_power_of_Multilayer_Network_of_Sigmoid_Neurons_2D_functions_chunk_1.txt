is simply the x1 comma x2 point on this planet where the salinity is equal to x1 and the pressure.
is equal to x2 and same the all the points here are just the x1 x2 coordinates where x1 is.
silent and pressure x2 is pressure right now it so happens that some of these points you have found oil.
which are the orange points and some of these points you have not found oil which is the blue points.
right so now what is my decision boundary should look like i cannot have a decision boundary like this right.
because it does not separate the blue points from the orange points you can see that i cannot no matter.
what i try i cannot separate the orange points on the blue points by drawing a line right because this.
is not linearly separable but if i draw i have a function which looks like exactly what has been shown.
here and let me just delete and use a better color you know not black maybe the function is 0.
