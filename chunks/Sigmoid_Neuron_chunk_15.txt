one if not you say zeros this if else nature is what is bringing this discreetness right we're just saying.
that okay it will suddenly become one right so it's the nature of the function itself this is a step.
function right and there'll always be the sudden change whenever you have a set a threshold function right and as.
I said like for most real world applications we don't want this we want the decision to be much smoother.
where the difference between 0.49 and 0.51 is not yes and no right it should be something more smoother than.
that right so let's see how do we get there now this looks like a smoother version of the function.
right so what is happening here again this is my z-axis okay and this is what Z is right and.
now I have not explained what this function is I have not given you the formula for the perceptron I.
have given you a formula that Y is equal to 1 if something Y is equal to zero something I.
