foreign [Music] okay so I'll just demonstrate that algorithm in a toy setup right now whatever we did right so.
this is a function that is given to us and as you can see that this function has multiple minimally.
that's one here there's one here there's one here and I'm just going to try to follow the gradient descent.
rule right which is wherever I am currently which is w I'm just going to do W minus ETA W.
right so that's my going to be my new value so right now I want a value of w which.
is 1.2 okay I have done the computation there I have calculated the derivative okay so remember that derivative of.
x square for example right is 2X but now if I compute the uh this value at x equal to.
1.2 then I get some scalar number right so that's what I'm going to do here so my w is.
equal to 1.2 so whatever is the derivative in that formula I'm going to plug in W equal to 1.2.
and I'm going to get some answer for what the derivative is right and then my ETA is set to.
