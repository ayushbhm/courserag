of x for me and this is h of x for me so i'm just going to substitute g of.
x and h of x so this is derivative of g of x with respect to x so i'll have.
derivative of this is my g of x with respect to a l i into 1 by h x so.
i'm just dividing it by h of x right and then uh i'll not explain this entire formula it's like.
two conversion uh to speak it out right it's not uh difficult but it's just too cumbersome to speak it.
out this is again g of x as you would as you would notice this is again h of x.
so this is just what i'm substituting then this is h of x square right so all of this is.
uh the routine substitutions that i'm making in the original formula once you get that this is g and this.
is h and you buy this formula the rest of it is just plain substitution right now let's try start.
computing these derivatives so now i am taking derivative of a l i with respect to uh the exponent of.
a l l right so let's see what am i trying to do again i had this vector a l.
