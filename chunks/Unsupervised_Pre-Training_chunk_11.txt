hidden and output and this is a shallow Network and shallow Network training was not a challenge right so I.
could train a shallow neural network so I've reduced my problem to training a shallow neural network now how do.
I go from here again because eventually I want to train the Deep inner Network that is not clear now.
but the first step is to just learn layer 1 effectively is that clear no no this could be W1.
and W2 yeah so you when you compute the loss you are using that right so excited you are Computing.
the difference between X hat and X so there you are using that information right what was my original input.
so loss is defined in terms of what your original input was right so that is getting used there so.
it will be the same depends upon the input layers right no so this is n dimensional and then you.
are reconstructing the n-dimensional input yeah right yeah yeah okay so ah so this is what we have done now.
