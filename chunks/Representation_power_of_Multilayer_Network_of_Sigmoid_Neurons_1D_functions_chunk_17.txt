called the tower maker if I have that then I have given you a network which can approximate from given.
function to any arbitrary degree of precision right this is exactly the cartoon version of the network now you need.
to quantitize it why is this the cartoon version of the network it takes an input X okay and it.
gives an output which is f of x which is an approximation of the original output the thinner my Towers.
the better the approximation would be so I could control that knob now the only thing missing here is what.
the tower makers are right so I give the input make the towers add them all up and that's what.
my network is looking like Okay so let's see okay so our job now is to figure out what this.
Tower maker black box is okay so we'll figure that out so let's start uh yeah let me just see.
what I want to do on this slide um yeah so I have an input X let me just explain.
what all is obvious here at the input X okay and I have two parameters W1 B1 W2 B2 so.
