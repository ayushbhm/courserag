are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and of course it's also reflecting in the performance of these models is.
not just like a race of building the biggest model but also show performance improvements by doing that right and.
then while these were happening in language transformers have also entered vision and here on the dark yellow axis i'm.
going to show you the evolution of image classification so you had this 2012 you had lx net which was.
first participated in the image net and won that competition although it was still around 16 percent or so error.
rate and then we had multiple convolutional neural network based models around the same time in object detection there was.
this move from the traditional object detection methods to a cnn based method rcnn and then there was an entire.
family of models of our cnn which came out and in parallel and image classification we had rest network so.
