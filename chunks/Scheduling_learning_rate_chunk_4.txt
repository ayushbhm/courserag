value is not the right thing and then what do you set the learning rate to right so here are.
some tips so what we typically try to do is that uh at least so now just let me just.
kind of step back and contextualize this right so nowadays like for most uh areas that you would work in.
right suppose you're working in machine translation or say automatic speech recognition not text to speech you would be building.
up on work which is already being done right so you would already have these Transformer based models someone has.
trained it for many languages and so on so you would have a fair sense of what were the hyper.
parameters they used and you would try to follow them and just experiment in a small window around it right.
but the tips here are for the more generic case where you're looking at something new and you don't really.
know no one has actually looked at the kind of data that you're looking at or the kind of application.
