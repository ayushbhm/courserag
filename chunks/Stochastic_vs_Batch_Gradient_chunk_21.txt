momentum based gradient descendant so you are taking the derivative or you're taking Computing the gradient from all the points.
but the reason you still see oscillations is because you have this very steep slopes and you are moving fast.
so you're over overshooting and then trying to come back whereas the black curve has these oscillations uh because of.
the stochastic nature of the estimates right so you're not making perfect estimates so you are going here and there.
and then coming back right and also see that they diverse right initially they both Go in different directions and.
the reason for that is that maybe the first few points that you selected in the stochastic version they were.
not a true representation of the total gradient right so they said okay I need to go in this direction.
and you went in that direction and then you later had to course correct and come back whereas when you're.
