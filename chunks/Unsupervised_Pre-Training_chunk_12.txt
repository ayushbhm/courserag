are reconstructing the n-dimensional input yeah right yeah yeah okay so ah so this is what we have done now.
once we have understood this we're just going to repeat this process again right and let's see what I mean.
by repeat this process again yeah this is all written in words whatever I had said and yeah and one.
important thing is where is the word unsupervised coming in here right so remember that in this problem that I.
have I'm currently interested in solving there is no y There Is No Label here hence it is in unsupervised.
I am just having the inputs and my loss function completely depends on the input so I don't care right.
even if you had not given me y I don't care so there is no label or supervision being used.
here and this is whatever I am doing right now is unsupervised later on of course I will move to.
a supervised objective but right now whatever I am doing is unsupervised ok now once I have done this I.
