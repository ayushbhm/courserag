right so let's see it at a l the all the computations that have happened so far this is what.
my al vector looks like right suppose it's minus 10 10 20 30 right so this is what my a.
l looks like and from that i am not happy with this because this is clearly not a probability distribution.
it has values greater than one it has also negative values right so this is not what i want from.
here i want to go to a y hat which is looking like a probability distribution right and what i.
have chosen is the soft max function so what i'm going to do how am i going to compute y.
hat from here so this is what my y hat is going to be so i'm just going to do.
e raised to minus 10 okay divided by uh and i'm just going to write it here e raised to.
minus 10 plus e raised to 10 plus e raised to 20 plus e raised to 30 right so this.
is what my first output is going to be that is what y hat 1 is going to be what.
is y hat 2 going to be it's going to be e raised to 10 divided by this same sum.
