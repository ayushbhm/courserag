I hope you can see it so these were the two points given to me these are the same two.
points that we have been looking at since the last lecture so x equal to 0.5 where the value of.
the function was 2.5 and x equal to 0.2 where the value of the function was 0.9 okay now I.
want to do gradient descent to find the right W's and B's so I've set W to minus 2 my.
initialization is minus 2 B is also minus 2 I have kept ETA is 1 and I have set the.
max epox as 1000 right so this is what my initializes are now for I in range of Max epox.
that means for thousand iterations I have initialized the derivatives to zero and for X Y in my data points.
right so all the data points and iterate over all the data points I'll compute the gradient with respect to.
W or the derivative partial derivative with respect to W I'd also compute so let's see now I want to.
compute the partial derivative with respect to W how will I do that so I have this function uh here.
