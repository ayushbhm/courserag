can again treat these as just two vectors and try to find the difference between them but given that you.
know that these are probabilities what is the special thing that you can do and the video that i pointed.
out says that you can use the cross entropy loss function so i'm going to rely on that and come.
back to the discussion on cross country right so this is the intuition that i want you to build that.
in the case of classification problems you have a true probability distribution which looks like one and all zeros that.
one will be on the class which is the probability mass of one would be on the correct class and.
zero on all other classes whereas your network will also predict some probability distribution because you will make an appropriate.
choice of the output function and now you're looking for a loss function which finds the difference between these two.
probability distributions so that's what you want to do in the case of classification so now let's fill in the.
