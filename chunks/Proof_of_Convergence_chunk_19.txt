than or equal to this sum let me just get rid of all the marks so this sum okay has.
a quantity which is negative okay this sum does not have that quantity so it follows that this sum is.
going to be less than equal to this sum that okay because it's just this sum plus a negative quantity.
so it's going to be less than equal to okay now the next step of course is to replace p.
i squared by 1 because p i's are normalized this was the simple assumption i had made now by induction.
again the same thing will happen i'm going to now i started with wt plus 1 and i ended up.
with this now i'm at wt i'll again do the same step there itself right and what will i get.
this is going to be wt minus 1 plus 1 right this will again happen this one which i had.
come here again the same thing will come here and i'll get 2 and how many such ones will get.
added the same argument as many times i make an update a 1 will be added right where is the.
