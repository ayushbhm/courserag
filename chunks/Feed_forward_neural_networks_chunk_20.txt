to remove that instead of a i of x that converts something i'm just going to write it as a.
i h i and so on right so that off x is something that i have deleted but it's understood.
that you have this input everything that is getting computed here all the white guys red guys and the green.
guys they are all the functions of the input right so that's very obvious i'm not going to write it.
explicitly it just makes the notation more cumbersome right so i have introduced a feed forward neural network now in.
the previous lecture we saw this supervised machine learning setup right where we said that in machine learning you always.
have an input x you know there's some true function which x is between x and y but you don't.
know that so you come up with an approximation of that function and that is your y hat right so.
i see a y hat here and this should have been f hat of x you can ask the t.
is to correct that with the f f x right so i have the x here and i have the.
