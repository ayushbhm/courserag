the right right right right and now suppose imagine you are on a scooter because now you are fast and.
you go very fast okay people have said Gora so you just zoom and go now what will happen you.
will cross the mall and go ahead right and then you'll have to take a U-turn and come back and.
you're taking a U-turn people will say okay go in the left direction or go this way and again you.
will say Okay many people are saying that so let me go fast then again you might overshoot and then.
again come back take a U-turn come back and so on right so going fast is not always good as.
you'd say I mean you could imagine in any navigation problem you just keep going fast without checking whether okay.
everything is fine you might overshoot and then I have to take a U-turn and come back right in fact.
and this is what the u-turns are what we saw on the momentum gradient descent right so it actually overshot.
