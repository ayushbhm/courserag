so you just pass that a and you substitute in this formula so you get G Dash right that's all.
that this says and in fact it can be written even more uh simply it's just G of Z into.
1 minus G of Z you can derive this this is not and similarly for this you can derive and.
it's just 1 minus U of Z square right so those G primes are easy to compute so that's all.
I had so if I got this formula as saying right so if I had H already right and if.
I want to compute G then I already have G Prime then I already have everything that I wanted to.
compute right so this is all we are done with the entire back propagation algorithm uh we have seen it.
in quite gory details uh you have to watch these videos a few times to get a complete grasp on.
it but everything that you need to understand it is there in the videos and the slides so please look.
at it so I'll end here and the next class we'll go back to gradient descent and look at a.
few variants of your data so thank you.
