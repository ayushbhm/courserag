looks like every machine learning problem you can cast it into this matrix where you are given the x's and.
the y's and you are given many such x comma y pairs okay now this is where now uh thinks.
uh the challenge is right this is what the crux of machine learning is so we have a y right.
and we have a reason to believe that this y depends on the input x right so what is the.
y here the box office collection and it depends on the characteristics of the movie right this depends this equation.
is still not complete y is equal to x is not what i want to write i want to write.
something else but i'll come to that right i'm saying that y depends on x then similarly in the interest.
rate y depends on that all the inputs that i'm taking and even in the first example of oil it.
depends so what do you what's the mathematical way of saying that something depends on something y is equal to.
a function of x right so i would say that y is equal to f of x right now if.
