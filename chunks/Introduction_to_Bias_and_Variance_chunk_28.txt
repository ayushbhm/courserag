are you are obtaining for f hat of X right and hence the variance so for the complex models the.
variance is going to be high right so that's that's what we have observed so in summary informally what have.
we observed that simple models have high bias low variance complex models have low bias High variance and now there.
is always a trade-off between the bias and the variance right so now I can't say that let's always choose.
a complex model because I know that if I choose a complex model I'll have a low bias right which.
means I'll be able to overfit the training data but I also have a high variance that means that depending.
on the training data that I had gone my models would be quite different from each other and that's not.
what I want right because if my models depending on the training data that I've got if my models are.
largely different from each other then I don't know how they'll perform on a test data so let's let's look.
