is what my first output is going to be that is what y hat 1 is going to be what.
is y hat 2 going to be it's going to be e raised to 10 divided by this same sum.
then e raised to 20 divided by the same sum and then e raised to 30 divided by the same.
sum right and now you can understand that the sum of these values is going to be one right because.
it's the sum of all the values is the denominator so the sum of the four values that i'm going.
to compute here is going to be 1 and each of these values is going to be between 0 and.
1. why is that the case let's try to understand that why is that the case so my original vector.
my original vector was say minus 10 10 20 30 right and now each value that i've computed is e.
raised to the corresponding value divided by the sum of the e raised to all the values right now even.
if i have a negative value in my original vector e raised to that is still going to be positive.
