and Y but now when I'm around 2 right or maybe say around yeah let's look at around 2 here.
here I see that the slope is much more steeper what is happening there when I change X from 2.
to 2.5 my y changes much more rapidly right so y changes from 4 to 6.25 so the difference here.
is 2.25 as opposed to 1.25 here so I did the same change in X my change in X was.
constant which was 0.5 but in one uh neighborhood my y change is very a lot the change in y.
is very high right that means d y by D X would be high in that region that means the.
gradient would be high and that gradient is essentially the slope uh of the function uh at that point right.
so in those regions the slope is very high and the slope is essentially the derivative so wherever I have.
steep slopes there my d y by DX or the derivative would be high and hence this quantity would be.
high so if this quantity is high my update or the change in W would be high and when I'm.
