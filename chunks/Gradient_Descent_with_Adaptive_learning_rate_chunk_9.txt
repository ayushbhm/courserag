right so that's what a sparse feature looks like and again as you can imagine in real world applications there.
are many features which are sparse now what's the consequence of that right so if my derivative formula that I.
just showed you as the sum right is summation I equal to 1 to M then that quantity that I.
just mentioned multiplied by this feature value right this is what my derivative is going to be right and now.
if this feature is very sparse that means when I am taking the sum for if this m is equal.
to thousand and out of 1000 times if 990 times this feature is going to be 0 then 990 terms.
in this derivative are going to be 0 right that means my total derivative that I am going to compute.
is going to be very sparse for features uh is going to be very small for weights corresponding to sparse.
features now what's the consequence of that the consequence consequence of that is that in my any gradient descent based.
