walls there is no opening anywhere right you cannot see a white surface anywhere because on all four sides the.
wall has closed right but still i'm not there right it is not like a tower yet i mean there's.
a tower somewhere inside this middle portion this portion here right this okay maybe i should not have drawn it.
like that okay so this portion underneath this block here right that is the tower but i'm getting a lot.
of extra things also along with it right so there's some some things coming out and i don't want those.
for now so i'll see how to get rid of those right but for now you get what happens one.
the main thing to note is that now the walls have closed as i've shown you at no point in.
that region you cannot see uh you can see a blue wall then you can see the cyan wall here.
then again the blue or the purple wall and then again the cyan wall right so it's it's you have.
a tower sitting somewhere inside that so now let me look at the sum of these two functions right so.
