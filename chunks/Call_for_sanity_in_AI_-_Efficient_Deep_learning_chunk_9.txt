passed through a facial recognition kind of a software right which looks at images and try to make certain judgment.
about the people right and the first image it has classified as low risk so this software was trying to.
predict whether uh the people in the images being shown could become criminals in the future or might commit some.
crime in the future right so the first person it's showing it's low risk on a scale of one to.
ten just three whereas for the second person it's showing high risk on a scale of one to ten it's.
eight right but now if you look at the past record of these people then the person in the first.
image has two armed robberies one attempted armed robbery and then after that again there was one grand theft right.
whereas the other person who has been marked as high risk had four uh juvenile offenses right or misdiminis and.
then after that there were no offenses right but what is happening here right is that since the second person.
