will compute the Z as a weighted sum of your Phi input vectors and the weights would come from the.
alpha right so very easy to understand now you had one vector you had H1 to H5 from each of.
these H1 h2h5 you computed three vectors using the carry query transformation key transformation and value transformation the query Vector.
is used to find the importance of all the words with respect to this word right so this is fixed.
and you're trying to find the importance of all the words so the vector contains the dot product between your.
query and all the keys that you have once you have computed the importance now you need to take a.
weighted sum of all the words so for taking the weighted sum you look at the value Vector right so.
that's how you have these three vectors which get used in this computation right so I think it's uh should.
be clear from the diagram and the equation how the zis will be computed so you'll just do this Z1.
