can write F of uh I can write this quantity okay let me just draw the other one so so.
I can write this quantity okay you ignore the X here because this x corresponds to this x right so.
this quantity P of X less than or equal to is given by this nasty formula without this x right.
and then I can just multiply it by X to get the formula that I have here another approximation of.
it is this right so it can also be given as X into Sigma of 1.702 X and I've drawn.
both these formula here and you can see that they are very close to each other and look like the.
CDF of the normal distribution right so that's why effectively uh the gelu activation function turns out to be f.
of x is equal to X into Sigma of 1.702 X quite a weird function but well motivated right so.
this formula if I just give you you don't you won't understand where it came from but now you from.
this derivation you understand that it's multiplying the CDF value with the X itself and the CD F value there.
