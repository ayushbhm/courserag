very close right i would say this weight is closer to the loss function and the weight that i am.
interested is much farther right but i know how to use the chain rule right so i can compute the.
derivative of the loss function with this guy which is the green guy dark green guy then the derivative of.
the dark green guy with respect to al1 and then i keep going down right and this is something that.
you have done right so if i could write y hat is equal to say sine of cosine of square.
of say tan of e of log of something right then you know how to compute this derivative right and.
that's that's the chain this is a very long chain and you see a very long chain here too but.
you know how to compute that right you just go about it one by one you compute the last guy.
the derivative of y hat with the last guy that you had then the guy previous to that and so.
on it just keep going uh in a chain that's a chain rule of derivative that all of you know.
