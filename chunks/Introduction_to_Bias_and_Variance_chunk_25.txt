used the right colors let me just use the right colors yeah so suppose I take any one of these.
blue lines from here and then I had the green curve which was the average right and it looks something.
like this then ah for every blue line I can find the difference from the green line right that is.
what I am trying to do and I can take the square of that difference and then I can do.
this for all the blue lines that I had and that's where the expectation is coming from so that's the.
variance right so it's the difference between uh the predicted value minus sorry it's the difference between the given model.
and the expected value of the model the square of that difference and the expectation of that right so this.
is very similar to I mean this is the definition of variance that you know from statistic right so you.
could look at it as suppose a fat of X you can think of it as a random variable Z.
