say 0.9 so at any point you're just taking uh let me just get rid of this yeah so now.
you are taking 1 minus beta which is 0.1 times the current gradient and also the history you are repeatedly.
exponentially decaying right the history continuously gets multiplied by 0.9 so whatever was my accumulated history that has also become.
0.9 times the previous history and my current gradient also I am not taking it fully I'm just taking it.
a fraction of it so that's why I'm not allowing my history to grow as rapidly as it was going.
in the case of adagra right so that's the change I have made in RMS prop uh and then the.
update rule Remains the Same right so now everything else Remains the Same the only thing that I've changed is.
this denominator VT which was earlier growing aggressively now I've added like these multipliers beta and one minus beta which.
are both less than one which means I'm scaling down right I'm not allowing the history to grow at every.
