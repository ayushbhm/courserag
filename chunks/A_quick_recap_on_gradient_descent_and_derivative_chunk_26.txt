this is how I would note the gradient as so it is the movement in the y direction divided by.
the moment in the X direction right so in those regions now let's see this this here is a region.
where the store slope is steep right and this here is a region where the slope is gentle so now.
let's see what does the derivative look like in these two regions okay so I'll just try to move the.
point so in this region uh you can look at the value being computed here right which is d y.
by DX that's quite high right the derivative is minus 3.54 now and all of this are very steep regions.
right now slowly the slope is becoming gentle and when I come here to this point right you can see.
that the derivative is very small right why is that happening it's obvious because here for a small change in.
X you are getting a large change in y and that's what the derivative captures but here when you're closer.
to 1 right let me come this side so when you're closer to 1 when you're changing X by a.
