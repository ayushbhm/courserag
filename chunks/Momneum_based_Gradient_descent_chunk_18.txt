right so now we have this kind of an input and we have a very weird looking 3D surface here.
right and this is what the contour map looks like and now I'm just going to focus on the contour.
map because the contour map tells me everything this is a flat surface and from this flat surface I am.
quickly moving into a value rate so there's a steep slope which takes me to a valley similarly here I.
have a flat surface and I am going into a Valley from a steep slope so this is a Surface.
where you have like flat surfaces here and then you quickly move into a Valley from both sides right so.
from all sides you have flat surfaces and then you quickly move into a valley so this is what it.
looks like is it's a very steep valley and now you can imagine right so if I put a ball.
here it will roll down it will not stop here it'll go up then again come back go up then.
again come back and it will keep oscillating it so let's see if this effect is what we see in.
