right so there are no other unknown or New Concepts in the equation of atom but this bias correction is.
the main New Concept which we have just understood why to do that okay so now let's see what would.
happen if we don't do bias correction right so we'll again look at the equations put in some values and.
try to see what happens right so this is the equation for VT okay and now suppose Delta W naught.
is equal to 0.1 okay uh so now V naught is going to be beta 2 times 0 because VT.
minus 1 was 0 and then 0.001 times 0.1 Square so it's going to be 0.0001 okay and now ETA.
T the effective learning rate is going to be 1 divided by the square root of this which is going.
to be 316.22 right so it already looks a very high learning rate to me right now let's see what.
V2 would be V2 would be 0.999 into V naught plus 0.01 into 0 square and that would give me.
this quantity okay and that is again a reasonably High Learning array right so what we are seeing is that.
