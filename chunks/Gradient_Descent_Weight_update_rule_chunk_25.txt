slowed down a bit why is it slowing down in certain regions why is it not going fast in other.
regions is something that we'll figure out but now it has started moving and you can see that the loss.
is around 0.02 I just run it for 100 iterations I've stopped it now I could keep running it a.
bit more of the side set to 200 so let me just make it 500 and I can keep running.
this you can again experiment with this at your own Leisure right so now you can see that it's moving.
further and it'll keep going patiently it'll keep going but it'll go in the right direction right I'm not worried.
that it will eventually lease the loss function right even 500 iterations does not seem to be enough in this.
case uh but if I just land it for a thousand two thousand iterations then it will reach there right.
but the key thing that you need to at least be happy about right now is that unlike a random.
gas guess algorithm here you are not making a mistake at any point at every time step your loss is.
