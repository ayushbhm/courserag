is quite high it's around 0.4 or 0.5 something like that okay so now I run the gradient descent algorithm.
so at every step I am going to change my w and B so this point that you see on.
the bottom is going to keep moving in the WB plane right so what you see here is the WB.
plane right so at every point I'm Computing a new WB so I'm just going to keep plotting that right.
and this is how it is moving right so I'll make as this I'll just play it once and then.
make a few observations or I'll keep making the observation so right now you can see that I'm on a.
fairly flat surface right and because of that I'm moving very slowly right my updates are very slow they're so.
slow that when you see on the bottom you don't are not even able to distinguish between two points W.
and B right because they're so close to each other they're just looking like a snake's body right but when.
I come here okay it's still running okay so when I came here let's see okay now let me just.
