video here i would recommend that you see the first five minutes of this video to understand uh what this.
is about right okay now the last section that i want to talk about is efficient deep learning so we.
are living in the era of mobile phones right and the number of smartphone subscriptions has increased at least in.
the context of a country like india there is increasing mobile penetration in the rural areas right what that means.
is that now you should start thinking about how do you serve this population which might not have computers right.
but they have access to mobile phones so can you build ai models which run for this particular form factor.
right and people have this uh good connectivity also so now there is increasing uh emphasis on designing models which.
can run on the edge right so if you have a drone can you which would have limited memory limited.
compute can you take your ai models and make them run on these devices right so that's another push that.
