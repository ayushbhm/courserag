be learned right so what would happen in the sigmoid case for example right this is what a sigmoid function.
looks like right and it will look like this s-shaped but depending on the values of w and b it.
will decide whether this is something like this something like this or is it something like this right so all.
of this will depend on your values of them so you can have a function form but you can adjust.
that form of the function by or adjust the shape of the function by using these parameters right so that's.
why if you don't have parameters and all your data is useless right if you just say my equation is.
this you have not even looked at the two points how do you know that those two points will satisfy.
this equation right so to look at the points and then come up with this equation right then you have.
to find the values of w and b so that's the same idea here that's why you need these parameters.
