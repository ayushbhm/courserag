right which means there are n inputs right and you have a function and you want to take a decision.
and this function is of course complex that you don't know what it is right so what claims were being.
made is that if you have this relation where you have an x you have some function which gives you.
out y right and if you give me enough instances of this which means okay yeah if you give me.
x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x 3 y 3 enough input output pairs of this function right.
so you have decisions that you have taken in the past for certain inputs then i could train a model.
right which could take again an input x and give out an output y which would be very close to.
the true y that should have been there right that is the claim that was being made right and what.
uh and that's why right i mean translation languages could be one such example you have an input which is.
a sentence and you produce an output and what was being claimed is i can make a model which can.
