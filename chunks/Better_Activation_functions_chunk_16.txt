the derivative of this with respect to W 1 this quantity disappears because it's a constant and the derivative of.
W1 h21 is just h21 similarly the derivative of W2 or rather eighth of the loss function with respect to.
W 2 would have an H22 here right again because derivative of A3 with respect to W2 this quantity would.
disappear and you will get an H22 right so this is fine this formula you understand now what's with the.
color coding right what's the red part and what's the blue part so the red part is common for both.
the derivatives right so this part is actually the same in both the derivatives okay and this part is changing.
okay this is h21 and H22 now what is h21 h21 is the output of the previous sigmoid neuron right.
so I know that this is going to be positive right both the blue quantities I know are going to.
be positive right now if both the blue quantities are going to be positive then the sign of these two.
