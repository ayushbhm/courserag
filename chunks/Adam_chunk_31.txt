to 0 this is going to be M minus 1 and that I have initialized to 0 right so this.
whole sum moves towards zero it becomes very small and then the same thing keeps repeating right because in the.
next time step again now at time step uh one again my value was around say 0.8 right so then.
I have 1 minus beta into 0.8 right and plus beta into my history so far which was around say.
point zero zero one right and now again this 1 minus beta is a very small value so that's why.
it will stay towards close to zero and it'll take a while to then start coming close to the two.
values because after a while now this is your history and all these initial parts are getting very very small.
weightage and these new guys are getting higher weightage so then slowly it kind of gets rid of its history.
because of the large power of beta right and then it starts relying more on the recent guys and those.
