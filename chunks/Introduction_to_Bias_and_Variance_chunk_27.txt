not very far away from the average and hence the variance is going to be small for the simple models.
right whereas for the complex models you can see that some of the blue lines are actually very far off.
from the average that we had right so the blue curve sorry not the blue lines so the here you.
have quite a bit of variance that you have right you can see that visually so you for the same.
input X there's a quite a bit of difference between the predicted value based on the different models that you.
have trained right there's quite a bit of gaps one model is predicting the value here the other model is.
predicting a value here similarly here if you look at for this point one model is predicting the value here.
there's another model which is predicting value here so there is quite a bit of variance in the values that.
are you are obtaining for f hat of X right and hence the variance so for the complex models the.
