quantity from it instead if I already had passed it a value which was already equal to this right because.
this I already had the previous time Step at the previous time step I already had M naught so if.
at the previous time previous time step itself I could have computed an updated value and send it here then.
I wouldn't have had to do this here right so that's the idea and you can see that what is.
happening here is that you have t t minus 1 and t plus 1 uh these are the three time.
steps that you see here right and instead can we write everything in terms of t and t plus 1.
and push the look ahead uh such that I don't have to do these computations again right so that's what.
we want to do so let's see what we are going to do about it so the key thing here.
is that the vector M naught or M minus 1 or M of T minus 1 is being used twice.
then you're doing this temporary computation which is W1 minus beta M naught and you compute the gradient there and.
