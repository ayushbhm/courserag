means you are only listening to the current instruction you are not really considering the fact that I've been constantly.
being asked to go in the direction okay people might have asked me to go in this direction but where.
am I asked where are people asking me to go in the current step in this direction okay I'll just.
follow that right but this entire history which was there that you were constantly being asked to go in that.
direction that is not being captured right so now instead of just moving according to the current uh derivative or.
the current gradient you are actually also considering the entire history right and this is a recursive equation and we'll.
just open this recursive equation soon but this is akin to kind of taking all your past gradients and giving.
them some importance and then moving in the cumulative direction right so that's what you are trying to do here.
and this would become clear on the next slide so let me just do that and then come back uh.
