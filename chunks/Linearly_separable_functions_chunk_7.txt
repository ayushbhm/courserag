the u and here's one function that you know which is the always off function similarly the always on function.
and you can see that from the numbering that they're going to be 16 such functions possible right and it.
simply follows that you have these four outputs right and each output could take 0 or 1 value so you'll.
have 2 raised to 4 which is 16 which is actually 2 raised to 2 uh raised to 2 right.
so this is the or function and this is the and function and then similarly you can construct other functions.
right so in uh of these how many are linearly separable so you can go and work this out on.
your own and turns out that all except xor and the not xor function are linearly separable you can go.
back and verify this so it's out of 16 there are two functions which are not linearly separable so in.
general how many boolean functions can you have from n inputs it is 2 raised to 2 raised to n.
right so that's what happened here it was n was 2 so you had 2 raised to 2 raised to.
