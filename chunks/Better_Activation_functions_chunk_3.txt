these composite non-linearities but if you remove the non-linearities then you just have a linear transformation of X and then.
you are just going to learn linear decision boundaries right because you have just said that Y is equal to.
w x so your y you are just assuming that the relationship between Y and X is given by a.
line or a hyperplane in higher Dimensions right so then in particular if you have these complex decision boundaries like.
that we had here where you really need something long linear right so here you are not learning a line.
you need something like a circular either a decision boundary which separates the positive points which are inside the brown.
points from the negative points which are the blue points right I cannot draw any line which suitably separates my.
uh the brown points from the blue points right without giving me a high error so that is not possible.
