that if I just move along this line right so instead of moving along this curve which is what you.
should have done you are moving along that line and whatever value you get on that line that is the.
value you are assuming for y1 right so that's an approximation and you can already see right that this value.
here let me just mark it with a different color right so this blue value here is what you would.
get right that's the point on the line it's slightly above the red curve right so it's an approximation you.
will get some error there because you have done a linear approximation right now let me just get rid of.
all this content and now let's see if I had done a quadratic approximation that means if I had cut.
the formula here right so what happens in that case this is what the formula looks like right and just.
as the first one was of the form Y is equal to MX plus C right and here you have.
a quadratic term so this is nothing but Y is equal to ax Square plus BX plus C right so.
