me just go back and then try to find some new Delta Theta change that and I mean change that.
much and then find a new value I don't want to do that someone has to give me the right.
Delta Data to use and it turns out that what is the right Delta Theta to use the answer from.
this comes from the Taylor series right so let's see first what is Taylor series I'm sure some of you.
have seen this in high school well let's quickly refresh this right so Taylor series as I'm just going to.
read out the definition here is a way of approximating any continuously differentiable function right and this is important for.
us because whatever loss function we are dealing with is a differentiable function because we have the sigmoid neuron which.
is differentiable and then on top of that a loss function currently is the squared error loss which is again.
differentiable right so this is a differentiable function that we are dealing with and this differentiable function may have any.
