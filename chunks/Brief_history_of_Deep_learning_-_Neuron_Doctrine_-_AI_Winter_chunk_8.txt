and this structure where you have neurons and they have connections between them is what kind of forms the foundation.
of modern deep neural networks also it took over quite a bit of time and progress in different fields to.
come to this conclusion which then motivated work uh in deep neural networks or neural networks at that time which.
has now evolved to where it has right so quite a bit of history and quite a bit of developments.
from different fields which have led to this place right so now moving on or in fact there is one.
more before we move on right there's one more thing about the brains which there was a great debate about.
which was uh whether the processing in brain is localized or is it distributed so what it means by means.
that there was one group which felt that if you're talking about speech or vision or any specific uh activities.
that the brain is responsible for they are localized there are certain portions of the brain which are responsible for.
