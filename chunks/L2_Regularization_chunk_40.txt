slope right so this Gap if you remember indicates the slope the slope here is smaller that means a small.
change in W does not cause a large change in uh the loss right whereas along this axis the slope.
is steeper because this Gap is small so small change in W causes a large change in the law side.
so this figure kind of summarizes everything that we wanted to understand about L2 loss it tells us what does.
the shape of L2 loss look like it tells us what the optimum is in the absence of L2 loss.
and then it tells us how there is a compromise being made where you are shrinking the weights but you.
are not shrinking all the weights uniformly you are shrinking them according to different proportions and that's exactly what is.
happening here and these proportions actually decide are decided based on which directions are important and which directions are not.
important because the eigen values these are remember the eigen values of the Hessian and the eigen values of the.
