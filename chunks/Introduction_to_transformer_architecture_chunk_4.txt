Computing here is H1 which is a function of h0 and x 1 right and now once I have done.
that this H1 then becomes an input to the next computation because H2 will be computed as H1 comma x.
2 right so let's see this in the figure now so I have which one I compute H1 then I.
get the next input which is enjoyed right it has some another sentence so I think it's I enjoyed the.
movie Transformers so I got H1 and now I use that and H1 right so essentially I'm using this function.
which is H1 comma X2 to compute this hidden representation or this yellow representation that you see here right so.
what is happening here is that my computations are happening sequentially although my input was given to me at one.
go I had the entire sentence at one go and now let's just get rid of some of these annotations.
and just see the whole thing right so I had the entire sentence I am still Computing it one step.
at a time and I'll compute it at Z H1 then H2 then I am Computing H3 then H4 and.
