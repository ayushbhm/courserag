uh decision is of course W1 it's uh sorry yeah so it's w naught plus W1 X1 plus W 2.
x 2 greater than equal to 0 then the output would be 1 otherwise it would be zero right so.
now let me just fix this as W naught s minus one right so that is what I have done.
here so my w naught is fixed to minus 1 okay again I did the same thing okay okay so.
w naught is minus one and I will try different values of w one W two right so it just.
so happens that the first value that I tried was W one equal to minus 1 w t equal to.
minus 1 and that is the line that I have drawn here so this since W naught is minus 1.
of course the Y intercept is minus 1 and then I have minus x 1 minus x 2 and this.
is the line that I get now what is wrong with this line yeah so obviously if you look at.
the negative half space of the line which is shown in the red region right and now this is an.
example where it's clear that it's not always correct to say lies above the line right because these are all.
