that is what convergence means i will just cycle through the entire data and if i do not have to.
change my w that means all my positive points have the right angle with w a right angle meaning the.
correct angle with w and all my negative points also have the correct angle with w so i don't need.
to change anything right so that's how it has changed now the question whether i could have just kept toggling.
so i picked up n2 i had to make a change if i pick p1 i had to make a.
change at the beginning you saw you were making changes so what if these changes were counterproductive right it just.
moved somewhere then again it moved somewhere and it ended up changing the angle with the original point which i.
had corrected in the last step right so that is not yet clear right whether the algorithm will keep toggling.
or whether it will converge that is not clear that something that we need to see.
