see this is what the learning rate curve looks like right I'm the same plot I've plotted separately so the.
red curve I plotted in a new plot so that I can have more range on the y-axis so the.
y-axis tells you the learning rate and the x axis is the number of iterations as the number of iterations.
keeps increasing the learning rate keeps decreasing exponentially right so here it's continuously decreasing okay and here for example in.
the first step the learning rate was 0.72 because I had initialized ETA to 0.1 and then the denominator turned.
out to be 0.01 because V 0 turned out to be uh something which led to this point zero one.
nine and then my learning rate initially was 0.72 but as I kept going down it decreased exponentially right so.
the main thing here to show is that my I had kept my learning rate initially learning rate is 0.1.
but it became 0.72 right because initially my history was not large and hence the learning rate increased and then.
