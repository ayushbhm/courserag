at your VT it is increasing and then it starts decreasing also right so e v t can decrease in.
the case of RMS prop and why does that happen can you think about an answer for that what is.
it uh no no but it's an accumulation of the history right so the accumulation should keep growing right so.
how is the accumulation decreasing in the case of undergrad we said that VT is an accumulator so it's keeping.
adding terms so it should only increase and in whatever it's adding if it becomes zero then it will become.
steady at that so here why is it increasing and then it can decrease also why is that happening same.
for uh now we are taking VT Square we are taking Square so direction does not matter see the reason.
this is happening is because of the exponentially decaying average right so now uh initially if you look at the.
sum so say at time step T the sum was some uh so if you look at the derivative at.
