the previous layer i multiplied them by the weights and the biases and then i get so this y hat.
will tell me i can't do anything right whatever these guys gave me i just computed soft max on that.
and gave you some values so if these guys had given me perfect values then i would also have been.
perfect so please go and ask them you say okay this is fine that sounds interesting sounds correct that if.
these guys are not doing the job properly then how will the shaded guide do its problem joint property so.
you go and talk to these three guys who are these guys w's h and b right so the w.
and uh b so you ask them what is wrong with you right so the w and b say yeah.
we understand we have made a mistake because we are the weights we are the only things that can be.
adjusted in the network and maybe we have not really been adjusted very well so far and hence the output.
is bad right but then hl says that okay i am also part of this computation but i can't do.
