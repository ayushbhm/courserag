it solve my problem is still not clear but right now we are just trying to understand what the equations.
are right so instead of one history which was VT I have two histories now it's also clear that one.
history is kind of ahead of the other history right so VT was tracking everything that is happening up to.
this time step but UT is also tracking what has happened at this time step because it was also taking.
into account the current update which has been made okay uh so these two changes are these two ratios are.
being uh these two histories are being tracked and then I'm taking a ratio of these two histories and that.
is my effective learning rate so how does this help is the question okay foreign that's what I meant by.
that one history is running ahead the other St VT is already used in the current iteration but the UT.
that I have computed now will be used in the next iteration as UT minus 1 right so the numerator.
