so I know that this is going to be positive right both the blue quantities I know are going to.
be positive right now if both the blue quantities are going to be positive then the sign of these two.
gradients is decided by the red quantity right and the red quantity is the same for both the gradients so.
now both the partial derivatives so now ah either the red quantity is negative in which case both these derivatives.
are negative or the red quantity is positive in which case again both these derivatives are positive right so I.
cannot have a situation where I have my gradient Vector which contains all these ah derivatives and either it will.
be all positives or it will be all negatives right and this would be true even if I had like.
n neurons here the same argument I could have extended to it so if I had computed those n partial.
derivatives I would have had this red term common and then this blue term the blue term is always positive.
