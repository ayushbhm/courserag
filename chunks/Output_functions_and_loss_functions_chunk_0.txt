[Music] okay so now let's talk about output functions and loss functions right so this is where we were we.
wanted to understand how to choose a loss function and that in turn would depend on what your output function.
is so let's look at that right so the choice of loss function depends on the problem at hand and.
what i'm going to do is that i'm going to talk about two very popular problems side one is regression.
and this other is classification and in most cases like 90 of the problems that you deal with would fall.
in one of these two categories right so if you do these then we are largely covered from an application.
or perspective right even from the understanding perspective right so let's look at what these two examples are so the.
first example is that i have an input about movies and i want to predict the ratings for the movies.
right and these ratings could be the imdb ratings or the critics rating or the rotten tomatoes rating right now.
