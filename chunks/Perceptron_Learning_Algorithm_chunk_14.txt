would be the angle between these points and the weight vector again just by looking at the picture it is.
clear that the angle should be greater than 90 degrees right so if i consider this point here this angle.
is clearly greater than 90 degrees because i mean you know it is greater than 90 degrees okay so that.
also is clear now right so now let us try to relate uh the expression that we had with this.
geometry right this simply follows from the formula so you had the cos alpha is the formula for that is.
w transpose x divided by the norm of w and norm of x right so if w transpose x is.
greater than zero right that means cos alpha is greater than zero if cos alpha is greater than 0 that.
means alpha is going to be less than 90 degrees right so that is what it follows from because the.
points lying in the positive half space satisfy this expression this inequality that's why the angle is going to be.
