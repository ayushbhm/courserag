raised to the corresponding value divided by the sum of the e raised to all the values right now even.
if i have a negative value in my original vector e raised to that is still going to be positive.
right so that's one thing for sure that once i compute the y i's there are going to be no.
negative values there right the other thing for sure is that the sum of the values is going to be.
one right so two criteria that we have for probability distributions are satisfied since the sum of the values is.
1 and every value is going to be greater than 0 that means that each of these values is going.
to be between 0 and 1 right it cannot be greater than 1 because then the sum cannot be 1.
because every value is positive and it cannot be negative because it's all e raised to something and even if.
the original value is negative so e raised to minus 10 is going to be 1 over e raised to.
10 and this is still going to be a positive value right so i've taken the original computations al that.
