we have made some observations about the gradient descent algorithm right and from here I want to move forward and.
talk about why are we making those observations right what's the Intuition or are we yeah what's the intuition behind.
the observations that we have made okay so let me go to the next slide yeah so now so let's.
ignore this figure for now right so what we observed in the previous slide was that when the slope when.
the curve was gentle right those ah yeah at the the red portion at the top or the pink portion.
at the top the slope was very gentle my movements were very small when the slope became steep My movement.
was a bit fast and then again when I came to this gentle slope my movement became slow right I'm.
trying to now and get a reasoning for this right why is this happening so what exactly is happening there.
right so what is our movement right what do I mean by the movement so let me just make that.
