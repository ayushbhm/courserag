of X that they did not have any say in the estimation estimated parameters of f hat X because this.
belongs to test data and the test data did not participate in the estimation of f hat X right so.
now these two quantities are actually independent that means Epsilon and this quantity is independent right because y Epsilon is.
simply y minus f of x and that means the covariance between Epsilon and this other quantity is going to.
be 0. right because these two are independent random variables so there ah covariance is going to be zero right.
so that's why you can say that in this case when you are trying to estimate these expectations from the.
test data your the covariance term is actually going to be 0. yeah so I mean sorry I should have.
said it a bit differently so the expectation of e Epsilon comma this random variable can just be written as.
the product of the two expectations and ah so sorry I shouldn't have said that they are in sorry so.
