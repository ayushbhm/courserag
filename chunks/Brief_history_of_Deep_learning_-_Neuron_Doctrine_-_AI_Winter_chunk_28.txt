a multi-layered network of neurons right not unlike what papad and minsky had said that a single neuron cannot do.
it they said that if you have a multi-layered network of neurons right then you could take an x given.
many such examples you could learn a model such that now if you feed an x to it the y.
that it predicts would be very close to f of x which is the true value of the y that.
you would have got if you knew what that function is right so what it means is that what i'm.
trying to show in this diagram is this orange curve that you see here right okay somehow the pen is.
behaving a bit strange yeah the orange curve that you see here suppose this is what my actual f is.
and i don't know that right and now i'm trying to approximate it and those i'm doing that approximation with.
the help of these uh rectangular bars that you see right and what this was uh this theorem said is.
that if you have a very deep neural network or a multi-layer in fact it said even if you have.
