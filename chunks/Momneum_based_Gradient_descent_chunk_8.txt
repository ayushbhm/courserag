but you are also taking all the history into account right so that's what is happening in momentum based gradient.
descent and this beta is typically less than one right so typical value for beta would be 0.9 so what.
does that mean you are giving weightage of 1 to the current gradient that's the maximum weightage you are giving.
gradient of point weightage of 0.9 to the previous gradient weightage of 0.9 Square which would be 0.81 to the.
previous gradient so we are giving decreasing importance to your uh previous and previous gradients right as you are farther.
from the current step your weightage of that gradient is less but you are still accumulating all of that and.
hence collectively this sum should tell you right because instead of just moving with this now collectively you will be.
moving by a larger amount and that's exactly what you want on the flat surfaces because you're moving slow slow.
