is 1 1 into minus 1 which is minus 1 so 1 minus 1 will become 0 and plus the.
bias will become minus 2 which is less than 0 so this perceptron will not fire similarly you can see.
that for these two inputs this perceptron will not fire so this specific perceptron is only going to fire for.
this input because that's how i have confided the weights that's why i had this two red edges there minus.
one minus 1 because with that set of weights the only way this perceptron can fire is for the input.
minus 1 minus is that okay right similarly you can now go back and check right that the second perceptron.
the first perceptron will only fire from minus one minus one with the same argument the second perceptron will only.
fire for minus one one i'll show you how so this is minus one this is one so if your.
input is minus one minus 1 so we'll get minus 1 into 1 is 1 1 into 1 is 1.
so 1 plus 1 is 2 plus the bias is minus 2 so this quantity would be greater than equal.
