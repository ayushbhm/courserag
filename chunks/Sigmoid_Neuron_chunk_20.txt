you can have a similar explanation it's just that the graph will move a bit right so I'll leave it.
for you to figure that out but the what is the important thing is how do you get this s.
shape at large values it saturates at small values it saturates and it goes smoothly from the small values to.
the large values right so that's what is happening here and we no longer see this sharp transition which we.
are seeing in the uh step function earlier or the perceptron function right let's just delete this also the output.
Y is no longer binary right but it's a real valued output it's not zero or one many values between.
0 and 1 are possible now the other interesting thing about this function is that since the values are between.
0 and 1 right so what is the other quantity of Interest which lies between 0 to 1. probability right.
so probabilities lie between 0 to 1. so now this output of the sigmoid function we could interpret as a.
