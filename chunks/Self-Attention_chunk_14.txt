different sizes also right so if you had chosen this as D1 then your output would be D1 cross T.
right and so you could have either the D1 could either be bigger than D or smaller than D based.
on whether you want to generate just project to a smaller space or a higher space but that is not.
the main point here right the main point is that you had T inputs and you have t output right.
this is not changing right this capital T Remains the Same that means you had T input representations and now.
you have got T query representations from those t uh input representations right what do you choose the size of.
D1 and D2 is up to you in this example I have chosen it as 64 both D1 and D.
equal to 64. so if my input this was 64 plus T my output would also be 64 cross D.
thank you what is important as this T that you had T inputs and you got T outputs in parallel.
right you've got uh you did the entire computation in parallel similarly your value uh your key vectors you can.
