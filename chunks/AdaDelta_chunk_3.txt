that I have computed now will be used in the next iteration as UT minus 1 right so the numerator.
is one step behind the denominator okay so now the numerator uh is a function of the history as opposed.
to being a constant in RMS prop and add a grid so we have made it a function of the.
history we have got rid of the initial learning rate but does it really solve our problem is the question.
right and the other thing to note which will be important in understanding that it indeed solves our problem is.
that whatever uh derivative we have computed here whatever derivative we had computed we are already taking only a fraction.
of that in VT right and even the update that we have right we are only taking a fraction of.
that when we are looking at UT okay this is something important to note why and how this makes a.
difference is something that we'll see but the main thing to note is that we are only taking a fraction.
