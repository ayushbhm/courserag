general how many boolean functions can you have from n inputs it is 2 raised to 2 raised to n.
right so that's what happened here it was n was 2 so you had 2 raised to 2 raised to.
2 functions you can go back and convince yourself that if n is equal i mean if you have a.
general n number of inputs then the number of boolean functions would be 2 raised to 2 raised to m.
okay now of these how many are not linearly separable so when you had 16 functions two are not linearly.
separable so if you have two raised to two raised to n functions how many would be not linearly separable.
so many of you would try to say that the answer is n that's not the correct answer in fact.
this is an unsolved problem so you can go back and try looking for an answer for this right but.
that's that's not the point the point is that there are going to be some functions which are not linearly.
separable right and if that is the case with the simple boolean functions and i said in real world we.
