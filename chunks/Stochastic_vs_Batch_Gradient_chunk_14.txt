10 if I take 20 then would these oscillations reduce right what this uh I would would I please take.
closer to the green curve right I know in the limit if I take n equal to all the points.
then I would be exactly following the green curve right because and there's no surprise there right but if I.
look at a mini batch as opposed to the full data and as opposed to just one point if I.
look at a mini Point mini batch which is say 25 points 100 points then what my estimates be better.
right so that's the question uh so let's look at that uh so now we are using a mini batch.
version of gradient descent so in stochastic gradient descent you are updating after every point right whereas here you are.
keeping track of the number of points that you have seen and if the number of points is equal to.
some mini batch size let's say the mini batch size is 100 or 200 so if the number of points.
that you have seen so far if it's equal to some mini batch size then you make an update right.
