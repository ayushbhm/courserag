can see that I have a very arbitrary looking function right it's maybe I I it's not a sine X.
it's not a cosine X it's maybe a mixture of some of these functions right uh it's not x square.
X Cube or any of the standard functions that you might know now we are interested in knowing that if.
this is what my true relation is can I come up with a network of neurons that can represent this.
arbitrary function to a certain desired degree of precision okay that's what I want to do okay so let's see.
how I go about it so what we observe is that such an arbitrary function can be approximated by several.
Tower functions right so these are what I call as taus ok and I have constructed towers of certain widths.
and it should be obvious that so this this this sum of all these towers right or this the function.
that you see here outlined here okay and I can just go on is what my approximation of the original.
