for this discussion right we'll assume that uh true is equal to plus 1 and false equal to minus 1.
as opposed to 0 and 1 that we have been using so far right and we'll consider the case of.
two inputs okay and we'll have four perceptrons so since i'm going to have a network of perceptrons it is.
clear that i'm going to have more than one perceptron so now i'm going to start with four perceptrons right.
and each input is connected to all the four perceptrons okay with specific weights and the red weights are minus.
one and the blue weights are plus one okay why so all that we are not considering right now it's.
just that you have two inputs four perceptrons every input is connected to every perceptron by specific weights some weights.
are minus one some weights are plus one right and then the bias or w naught is equal to minus.
two okay so w naught is minus two so what is the perceptron rule w naught plus the weighted sum.
