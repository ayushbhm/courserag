go out of the valley because in the Steep regions a smaller learning rate would have worked and it would.
have not selected the larger learning rate which would have taken it out of the value right so it kind.
of works very nicely and it of course converges much faster than the gradient descent which was used with a.
fixed learning rate of one in this case right so I think that's the that advantage of line search is.
clear so that's all I have for uh today uh we are just going going over the slides the convergence.
is much faster we see some oscillations but these are not as bad as uh what we had in momentum.
and nag and overall the line search worked better right so that's where I'll end uh for today and in.
the next week we'll see uh some uh variations of gradient descent algorithm which use an Adaptive learning array okay.
so I'll see you next week thank you.
