this condition is satisfied and for all the negative points this condition is satisfied that means i have to been.
able to clearly separate my training data right and that's what i will define as conversions okay so while not.
convergence what will i do let's see so i'll pick a random point from the given set of points so.
the given set of points are the union of the positive and the negative points so i'll just mix up.
all this and pick a random point from there i'll call it x which is the notation we have been.
using and now if x belongs to p so remember that x in itself is uh x naught x 1.
all the way up to x n right so in our previous example these are the end decision features that.
i had is actor matt damon is the genre thriller and so on and x0 was this constant input which.
had been set to 1 right so that is what x the bold x looks like it's a vector and.
similarly you have these w naughts to w n right which is the vector uh w okay sorry about my.
