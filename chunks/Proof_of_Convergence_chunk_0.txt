[Music] so welcome back uh we're now going to talk about the proof of uh convergence right so the idea.
is that you have some intuition about how this algorithm works so let's now formalize it right whether it will.
actually converge or not right so i'm going to first state the theorem and before that i'll define something so.
two sets p and n of points in n-dimensional space are called absolutely linearly separable and i'm just going to.
read out the definition if n plus 1 real numbers w naught to w 9 exist and you recognize these.
numbers or these variables as the weights that i want right so that's what i want to find so of.
course the definition will contain these ways right so if such numbers exist such that for every point right and.
remember the points are themselves vectors right so this is oops a vector x 1 to x n belonging to.
p so every vector belonging to p satisfies this condition and similarly every vector belonging to n satisfies the other.
