the loss function with respect to H2 and then I should know these G's so I already know that that.
is not a problem right now suppose I wanted to compute the derivative of the loss function with respect to.
a 1 then I need the derivative of the loss function with respect to H 1 do I know that.
I know that because I had computed the previous formula and the derivative of H the loss function with respect.
to H1 depending on the derivative with respect to A2 and I just computed that right so I can just.
do it one by one at a time and keep going down the chain so now I have the formula.
for computing the derivative of the loss function with respect to the preactivation at any layer with respect to the.
activation at any layer and I just keep doing this one by one and whenever I want to compute something.
everything that I need for that is already compute right I'll just explain that intuition again so I started by.
