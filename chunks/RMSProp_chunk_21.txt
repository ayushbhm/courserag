saw three scenarios one where it converges one where it oscillates around a solution which is acceptable right so this.
is perhaps not as bad as this one right so it converges or it reaches to an acceptable solution or.
is like really far off from the solution right all three things could happen depending on how we have chosen.
the learning rate so this is in indeed not a favorable situation right so we may want to look at.
Alternatives and in most cases these initial learning rates for several problems have been kind of discovered through experiments I.
mean like for example for machine translation there are certain data sets training data sets which are used quite often.
right across different papers and so many experiments have been done with those data sets that people now have a.
good range of what is the right initial learning rate to use and in that case you might not set.
such CSS problems right but if you're dealing with an esoteric problem a new data set which only you are.
