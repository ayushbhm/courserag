itself could have different values right and that those values could come from some distribution right so these are your.
derivative values on the x axis and you have a distribution that means certain values here have a higher density.
as opposed to other values right and now at every time step because your updates are changing and your weights.
are changing and you're moving along uh the loss surface this distribution might be different right at some time steps.
you might expect more smaller gradients at terms time trips you might expect larger gradients but we are making a.
simplifying assumption here that every time step this distribution looks the same right so whatever what does this distribution come.
from where does the randomness come from so it comes from the data point that I'm picking up right I'm.
picking up random data points at every time step so depending on the time data point that I have picked.
