this model given the data that is would be given to me and using some objective function which makes sense.
right so that's what my quest is okay now then this is what my f hat of x is i.
generally use therefore fake side i mean i've explained the difference between f of x and f dot x but.
i'll just call it f of x and from the context it should be clear that i'm talking about my.
approximation because the true function of course is not known right so i cannot even define that right and i'll.
use sigma here which is written here is actually a short form or the notation for the sigmoid function okay.
so now we'll consider a very simplified version of this model right for all that explanation that there's only one.
input which is connected by the weight w and then there's this constantly on input which was connected by minus.
w naught but now to be consistent with the literature going forward we are going to call it as b.
