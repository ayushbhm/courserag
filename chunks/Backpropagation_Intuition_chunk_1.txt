there is slightly more work involved than what we had in that simple network that we had right so here's.
our gradient descent algorithm where we had this and we were just updating the weights using the gradients and we.
want to apply the same algorithm by replacing these by all the weights that i have in the network right.
the large number of weights and then be able to compute the partial derivatives of all those weights the same.
algorithm goes through right so now let's focus on one of these weights w112 and to learn this weight using.
the gradient descent algorithm we need a formula for the derivative of the loss function with respect to this weight.
right and that needs some work as i said right now what we want to do is first build an.
intuition for how what would that formula look like and then do some hard work but then come back to.
a state where we can then say okay once i know how to compute this this red guy can i.
