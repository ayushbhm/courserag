trying to say is that i can i have this generic template which has now four weights w1 w2 w3.
w4 everything else in the network has been hard coded right the only four variables are w1 w2 w34 using.
this template i am claiming that i can learn implement any of those 16 boolean functions which i had shown.
including the xor and the naught of xor function right which uh are not linearly separable to billing below begin.
with right so what does that mean is that i can learn specific values of w1 w2 w3 w4 for.
each of these 16 boolean functions and these might be different values for the different functions such that when i.
plug in those values and now i start feeding 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 then my output.
would be the desired output as per the truth value of that function that's the claim i am making and.
this looks like an astonishing claim right because i know that some of these functions are not linearly separable that's.
