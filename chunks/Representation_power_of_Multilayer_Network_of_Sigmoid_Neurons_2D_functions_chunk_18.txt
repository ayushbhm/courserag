of some function right now let me just call it as h now when i take this edge so this.
is h and i'm going to pass it through another sigmoid okay such that it switches over at one then.
everything which is less than one all of this will disappear and only these things at the top right which.
are greater than one will remain and what the result end result would be that i'll get my tower function.
out so if i delete this and i just show you the tower so this is what will remain right.
so this is just the part of the that entire structure which was above level one right and only that.
part will remain and i get my tower function which is now indeed close from all sides at which we.
were already convinced about right so you can go back play around with these visuals and convince yourself that you.
have got a 2d tower i am convinced that we have got a 2d tower by constructing a network like.
