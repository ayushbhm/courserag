a flat floor right you can imagine it's a floor in which you could have some places where you could.
hide you could construct a wall so that you can hide from the person who is chasing you if you.
are a chaser you could destroy a wild wall to find to look for people inside or you could build.
a ramp you can see that yellow ramp in the figure so you could climb up the ramp and peep.
inside the structure and see whether someone is hiding right and all of this the rl agents were able to.
learn uh quite well right that is the ability to chase and hide build a defensive shelter break a shelter.
use a ramp to search inside and so on as a very interesting demo video that you should see right.
and what is emerging in all of this the underlying theme is that very complex decision making strategies were being.
able to learn using these different deep reinforcement learning agents and while all of these specialized in like one task.
