neuron is more uh sensitive to this training data and maybe I should respect that right so when I'm updating.
can I update this better as opposed to updating this right because this is reacting weekly right so can I.
do that so one option of doing that is to take the yeah so this is the effect that we.
want right that we want to make these we want to acknowledge the fact that these neurons are sensitive to.
Turning certain training samples one neuron is more sensitive than the other and hence I should perhaps try to get.
this effect which I had in bagging where the neurons were adapting to the specific bucket of training data and.
now since this neuron has shown such some preference for this training data can I give it more preference can.
I make its updates better so as opposed to the relative updates of the other neuron right I don't want.
that other neuron to specialize for this training sample because it has not shown interest in this training sample right.
