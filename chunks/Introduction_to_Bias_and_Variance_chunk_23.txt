the expected value of the model ah so why is there an expectation here because where is the randomness coming.
from you are taking different random samples of the training data right so you might get if I give you.
one lakh samples for training I I might just have gotten this random sample from somewhere and giving it to.
you right so I might be able to depending on what random sample of the training data I have given.
you you would get different uh F hat X which means you will get different values for the parameters so.
across all these different ah values of the parameters if I take the expected value and then try to find.
the difference from the True Value then that's what the bias is and you can see that the green curve.
is ah much farther from the red curve so the bias is high whereas the blue curve is closer to.
the red curve so the bias is low right so informally we are seeing that simple models have a high.
