I am looking at here is a vector which belongs to RM right so that's the idea now so that's.
what I meant by this that X belongs to RN and now what is it that I'm trying to predict.
in this case I'm trying to predict a y which again belongs to R right so y again belongs to.
R because Y is again a real number I am trying to predict the quantity of the oil that I.
can get from that location right so this is a real world problem and you could think of various such.
real world problems right so another example could be if you want to decide what is the interest rate that.
you should set for a particular customer right as a bank and this often depends on the past history of.
the person whether he'll be able to pay at a certain rate pay back the capital and so on right.
so you might have factors like what is the salary what is the family size right what was the last.
loan that that person had taken how many years that those loan was repaid in what was the interest rate.
