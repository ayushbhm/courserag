by an appropriate Lambda then you could have some of equal distribution along these two paths and then you get.
almost zero centering and it depends on how you choose the value of Lambda and a few values of Lambda.
that people have suggested uh empirically uh derived are these Lambda values are Lambda equal to 1.05 or Lambda equal.
to 1.67 if you do this then you get some sort of zero centering and that's exactly what cellu tries.
to do right uh now upper now after these activation functions uh came up right then of course this question.
arises I mean till when can I keep discovering these functions right is there a better way of searching these.
activation functions can I automatically search for them right and there was this work which tried to search for Activation.
functions so think that there are many functions right this is a space of all functions possible you have Max.
you have I mean you have the relu here you have the logistic sigmoid tan H everything here right and.
