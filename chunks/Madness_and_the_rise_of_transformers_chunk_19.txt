of course it's not saying that they're completely out but since which have been around since 1980s right so we.
are seeing like uh massive paradigm shifts right in the way things are happening in these fields and now transformers.
are the talk of the uh town as far as the state-of-the-art models for uh image speech and nlp are.
concerned today right so yeah okay so now ah we were talking about uh the rise of the transformers now.
this perhaps should have been a separate section but i just have it here so in parallel while we were.
talking about image classification and object detection which are largely regression and classification problems there's also interested in generation right.
you should be able to generate images automatically right you are able to synthesize an image and there was a.
lot of interest in that over the past few years the first models to do this were variation auto encoders.
