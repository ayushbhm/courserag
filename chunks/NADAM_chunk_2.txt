at a later point I'll switch back to the this version of momentum okay um now you recall the equation.
for Mac the main idea in nag was that instead of looking at the gradient at time step T you.
first did the look ahead and then computed the gradient right that was the main idea in nag and then.
the rest of it of course Remains the Same right now what we're going to do is we're going to.
rewrite nag in a more convenient way and then import it into atom right or that rather than Port it.
to atom right so this is what we were doing in nag we were Computing a quantity called GT which.
was the gradient okay let me just write down the equations all of it first and then that becomes easier.
for me too explain okay okay so I'll just now walk you through the slide so we were Computing the.
gradient at the lookahead value right and once you compute the gradient at the look ahead value then you are.
