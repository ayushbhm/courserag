activation function so then ah because of these limitations right so at some point uh so now because of these.
limitations the tan H function is popular because one of the things that you immediately see is that it's zero.
centered right and then whatever explanation I gave at the end that is kind of taken care of of course.
tanh is not a new activation function it has been used since 1990s but we are just going over all.
the activation functions so sigmoid is the default that we start explanations with but now I have shown you certain.
problems with it and then tanh overcomes some of those problems it is zero centered uh but let's see what.
is the derivative of this so it's a derivative of this is 1 minus tan H Square X and again.
at saturation the gradients will vanish right and that you don't need to look at the formula the same problem.
as the graph itself shows you that if the function value lies here then the derivative is very small or.
