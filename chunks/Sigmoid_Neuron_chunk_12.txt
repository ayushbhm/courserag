or whether uh yeah whether you like or dislike a movie right now let's say we have basing our decisions.
only on one input which is the critics rating and the critics rating is something between zero to one right.
on a scale of zero to one a Critic has given some rating and we look at that and decide.
whether uh we want to watch the movie or not right now if the threshold is 0.5 and let's assume.
that the weight is one because there's only one input so it doesn't matter what the weight is so it.
will just give it one and uh what now in this case when the threshold is 0.5 and the weight.
is one so what about the case when the critics rating was 0.49 the output of the network would be.
dislike right because 0.49 is less than the threshold so I will not like the movie but now if I.
had a movie well it's a Critic rating was 0.51 then my output would be like right and this is.
why I say that this is very harsh right this is not how you would take decisions in real life.
