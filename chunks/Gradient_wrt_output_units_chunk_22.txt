have the sum of the exponents so what does that mean i have e raised to a l 1 plus.
e raised to a l 2 plus all the way e raised to a l k and i'm taking the.
derivative of this sum with respect to one of the e l i's right and what will happen all the.
elements in this sum will disappear except the one which corresponds to e a l i hence the derivative would.
just be e raised to a l i right so this is again straightforward i have a sum of terms.
only one of them depends on the variable with respect to where i'm com i'm computing the derivative so only.
that term will rem remain everything else will disappear right so all of this looks uh pretty straightforward don't worry.
if you're not getting is as i'm explaining it you can just pause the video and look at it it's.
very mechanical steps right so it's this exp just looks very annoying but it's just e raised to something right.
and you know the derivative of e raised to something with respect to that same variable is just e raised.
