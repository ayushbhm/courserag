come here again the same thing will come here and i'll get 2 and how many such ones will get.
added the same argument as many times i make an update a 1 will be added right where is the.
one coming from the one is coming from this quantity if i made an update then i had added a.
pi if i had added a pi then i'll get this p i squared term and i'll get a 1.
there so again here i'll have k right i'll keep simplifying this and i'll get to w naught square plus.
k by the same observation that we made about delta while dealing with the numerator okay so now we have.
the numerator is greater than equal to a certain quantity and the denominator square is less than or equal to.
certain quantity so now these two conditions combined with the definition of cos beta will give us the condition this.
cos beta is greater than equal to this quantity so i have simply substituted the numerator and i have substituted.
