foreign [Music] so you had this this is what is happening here so you had this one word embedding okay.
hi let's just call it H1 right if you want H1 H1 you did this linear transformation right so let's.
say this was an r t dimensional embedding then you could multiply it by a d cross D dimensional Matrix.
and again get a d dimensional vector and you could do the same thing at all these three places right.
so from now one vector you have been able to generate three vectors and you needed these three vectors because.
three vectors were participating in your attention equation earlier right so you have these three vectors now now what do.
you do with these three vectors so these are they just look at their names again so this was all.
the hi's that you had all the edges these were your matrices these were the learnable matrices the transformation matrices.
WQ for query WV V for value and w k k for key and what you get out is the.
