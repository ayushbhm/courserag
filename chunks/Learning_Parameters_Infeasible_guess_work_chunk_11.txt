this is equal to 1 over 1 plus e raised to minus of 3x plus b and b i have.
chosen s minus 1 so this is what my function looks like now in this function i'll plug in all.
the points that i have how many points do i have only two points so for one point the value.
would be the x is 0.5 and the other x is 2.5 so i'll plug in these values and i'll.
be able to compute this quantity and i already know what the true y should be right so i can.
calculate this so i'm just going to go ahead and calculate this right so this is what it looks like.
okay i just expanded the sum now i've going to calculate those values and this is what the values turn.
out to be now i'm just going to do the math and this is the value right so this is.
0.099 that's the loss if it was perfect the loss would have been zero right but this is 0.099 so.
that's how bad this is now i am able to quantify my answer using the loss value if you give.
