gradient descent and nestro accelerated gradient descent algorithm on that using that data and uh the law surface was something.
like this and I am showing the 2D loss surface but let's try to understand uh let's try to make.
a commentary on it and try to see what it actually is right so as you know this red means.
high so these are the regions here where the loss is a bit high and also in those regions you.
see that there's a slightly larger difference between consecutive contour lines that means they are a bit flat region right.
and this region is blue here okay so that means in that region the loss is very low and and.
also from going from here to here as we go down let me just change the color going from here.
to here as we go down the slope is very Steep and that is obvious because the difference between two.
consecutive contour lines is now very small right so then this is essentially a surface like this which is peaking.
