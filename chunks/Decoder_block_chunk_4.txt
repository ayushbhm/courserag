the inputs so these are the uh small H number of time steps which have been decoded so far right.
all the inputs have not been available because whatever has been decoded that comes in as input so whatever how.
many steps have been decoded so far only that many inputs would exist right then you have something known as.
the Mast multi-head self attention right uh so there's this Mast word which has been introduced here okay then again.
at the output of one layer you have the feed power Network so this as I said is the same.
exactly the same as what we saw earlier right so again the same thing is going to happen here you.
would have these inputs H1 up to h capital T right which would give you some intermediate outputs S1 S2.
up to St and maybe there's some space here maybe something else would come uh so maybe you'll get some.
other outputs uh let me call them M1 M2 up to NT and then finally all of that will pass.
