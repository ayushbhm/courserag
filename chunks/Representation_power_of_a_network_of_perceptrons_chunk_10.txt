input is minus one minus 1 so we'll get minus 1 into 1 is 1 1 into 1 is 1.
so 1 plus 1 is 2 plus the bias is minus 2 so this quantity would be greater than equal.
to 0 hence the perceptron will fire and you can check for any of the other 3 inputs it will.
not fire similarly the third perceptron will only fire for one minus one the fourth perceptron will only fire for.
one comma one okay so each perceptron is like kind of specializing for a specific input and it will only.
fire for that input and the question is so what right i mean what what how does this show that.
it can handle any function right so we need to go back to the uh the table that we had.
and the algebra the calculations that were happening there right so let's see what is happening here so if you.
have the xor function now xor function is the troublesome function because it's a not it's not a linearly separable.
function so let's see what will happen in this network for the xor function so when you have the input.
