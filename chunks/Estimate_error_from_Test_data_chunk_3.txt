function f we have been given a lot of training points right where these y's are known so those y's.
we know are coming from some relation f of x plus Epsilon so even if you don't know what the.
relationship is we are given some of these x's and the corresponding y's so we know the X comma y.
pairs right so we have some idea of what f of x looks like for the given X's that we.
have we do not know the full function but at least for the X's that are there in our training.
set we know what the Y's look like right so we have some of these and similarly F at X.
is also we can compute because we can pass the X through the function that we have approximated or the.
approximate function that we approximation function that we have used and that could give us y hat I right and.
then we could compute this as a difference so f x you could replace by Y and ah F hat.
X you could replace by this y hat right this is y hat which I often call it as just.
