[Music] hi uh so welcome back uh so we'll now talk about a typical supervised machine learning setup and this.
in my opinion is the most important module of the course of course as we go along i'll say this.
for many modules but i think this is the most important one right so please pay attention uh so this.
is what we have right so we looked at the sigmoid neuron and we looked at one particular function within.
this family which is the logistic function now what next right so we have seen this right so what what.
was our pattern when we had introduced uh perceptrons we saw the perceptron model and then what did we do.
where did it go from there we first looked at the algorithm for learning the weights right so we want.
the same thing now i've defined this but now how do i learn the weights that's not clear right so.
i want to have an algorithm which can learn these weights but before i had done the perceptron learning algorithm.
