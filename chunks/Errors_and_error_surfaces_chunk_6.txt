this yeah so error is a function of W1 and W 2 right so this is my W1 this is.
my W2 and along the Z axis I am plotting the error and what are the values that the error.
function can take integer values right it can either be zero error one error two error or three errors right.
those are the values that it can take so that is why you see this step function here so for.
certain values of w the error would be 0 which is the dark blue region for certain values it would.
be 1 which is the purple region for certain values it would be 2 which is the orange region and.
for certain values it would be 3 which is the yellow region right so that's those so now what I.
have done is I've taken all possible values of oops yeah I've taken all possible values of w one W.
two I've just restricted to minus four to plus 4 because that's all I can show on the plot and.
this and I have substituted that those values in the equation and then just counted the number of errors that.
