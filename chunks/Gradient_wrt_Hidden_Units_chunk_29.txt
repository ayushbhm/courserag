I want to compute the derivative of H22 with respect to a22 I can do that right I can apply.
the UV Rule and keep going and I'll be able to get it right so this quantity is easy to.
compute okay so that's why I'm not worrying about that yeah but apart from that it only depends on derivative.
of h 2 and that we just computed on the previous slide right so I'm I have everything that I.
want till this point then again I want to compute the derivative of the loss function with respect to H1.
and I know for that I just need the derivative of the loss function with respect to H2 and I.
need W2 these are the two quantities involved and I have that because I just come sorry not H2 uh.
A2 and W2 right so these are the two quantities that I need for computing derivative of the loss function.
with respect to H1 and I just computed now I want to compute the derivative of the loss function with.
respect to A1 so for that the two con the quantity that I need is the derivative of the loss.
