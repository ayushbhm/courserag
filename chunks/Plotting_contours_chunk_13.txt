2D surface so now I just have the WB plane and I can now I can see how the loss.
function is imposed on the WB plane right because I can draw the contour map and the contour map gives.
me all the information right it tells me what the loss levels are right it tells me what the loss.
levels are I can see all the loss levels here and also by looking at the difference between the loss.
levels I'll know what the slope looks like and now here again I see that in this region here right.
where the slope was sharp there is a sharp movement there is a rapid movement which happens let's play it.
again so now the slope is gentle so it's moving very small slowly on the 2D contour map here and.
then it as it moves towards the steep region now it will speed up and then again it enters the.
shallow or the gentle slope region and then again it will move slowly right and now I can just get.
rid of this 3D view I'll just work with the 2D view where I have the contour map I know.
