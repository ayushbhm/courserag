are looking for All Points which satisfy this equation and of course they will lie on a circle right so.
that's that's the how the norm works now what happens is that as uh you take larger and larger Norms.
right greater than 2 3 4 10 hundred then if you have small values of x 1 x 2 right.
then these computations become numerically unstable right because any small value raised to a large value will become very very.
small or the other way around right if they are greater than one again if you do 1.1 raise to.
100 it will just blow up right not maybe 100 but a slightly higher power than that it might blow.
up right and then you don't want that right so that's why L2 Norm is the most preferred uh Norm.
uh but as P keeps increasing and it tends to Infinity then something interesting happens so it's as P becomes.
Infinity then the norm just boils down to the max right so if you look at L Infinity Norm then.
