would be but now I can evaluate this at the current value of my w right so I'll just substitute.
the value of w and if I do that then I'll get a two real numbers so I'll get a.
real valued Vector right as opposed to a formula I'll get a vector so this is always this that you.
have the formula for the derivative then you can evaluate the derivative at a specific point by putting it those.
uh points uh the that point into the formula so that's what I mean by evaluated at w is equal.
to WT right so that's what this quantity is signifying that it's the partial derivative evaluated at that point and.
that's exactly what we are doing in the previous slide we are getting a real number at the end which.
we could add and subtract and so on right so that's the idea yeah so now we have a more.
principled way of moving in the WB plane we are no longer doing our guesswork we know that if we.
do we just saw a proof or we arrived with the formula mathematically that if we keep moving in the.
