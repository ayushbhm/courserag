faster right so here notice that the learning rate starts off itself with a very small value which is point.
zero one zero right and again I'd initialize the learning rate to the same value right so here again so.
here see remember the learning rate was 0.1 but your initial gradients were high because B is a very Spa.
dense feature so V 0 itself was 84.45 right and since that was high your initial learning rate itself was.
small and hence you are moving less aggressive in the direction of b as compared to gradient descent and uh.
nestro and moment right and that's why right these gradients are also getting accumulated very quickly it's already 84 this.
history right the blue curve that you see already starts off at 84 and it keeps growing from there on.
right that's why it reaches very high digits right it treats reaches five digit numbers and that's why your learning.
