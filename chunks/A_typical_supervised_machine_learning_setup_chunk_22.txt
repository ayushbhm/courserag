what should the goal of this learning algorithm be so when would you say that the parameters that i have.
learnt are good right so in the case of perceptron algorithm we had this loop which said while not convergence.
to this right and there we had assumed that the data is linearly separable so i will keep running the.
algorithm till no point moves right or still the w the new value of w does not move because all.
the points are on the correct side of the line or the play right that was fine but that was.
that means you were going for zero error right but now there is no idea of zero error as i.
said in most available applications we'll have to deal with minimum error right so then what should your learning algorithm.
do it should have a certain objective right in the case of perceptron the objective was to separate the data.
that means no point misclassified that means zero error now your objective function which is going to guide the learning.
