it that what is it that we are taking the average on so again the situation was I had certain.
training data and then I had certain test data and this test data had many X comma y pairs so.
the average error over all these X comma y Pairs and that's what this expectation stands for I want to.
take this mean error over all the X comma y Pairs and potentially there could be like a large large.
number of test points right so if I have built an image classifier this is an infinite set of I.
mean practically infinite a large number of images that I could feed it at test time at which it has.
not seen at training time right so every day I don't know how many images get uploaded on Instagram Facebook.
Etc so if you have trained a model using all the images that were there till today in another one.
week some million other images will get generated and now these are all of these images are not seen by.
