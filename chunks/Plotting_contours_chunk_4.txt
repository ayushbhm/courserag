ring for example corresponds to the level one right so this link here is level one ring this ring here.
is level 0.8 ring point six point four point two and so on right so that's how uh this has.
been uh drawn it's every ring corresponds to one value along the Z axis in our case or the X.
Y axis would be like the w b axis and the Z axis would be the loss axis so every.
slice here would correspond to the same value of the loss function because R cross along the ring the value.
of the loss function is there because we have taken a slice along the vertical axis right so you have.
a parallel plane so the loss would be the same across that axis right and when you look at it.
from the top uh this is how it looks like and that's exactly what the contour map looks like now.
there are certain other interesting things to be said about the contour map right and let me just get a.
hang of this I want to put certain view from which the point that I want to explain becomes easy.
