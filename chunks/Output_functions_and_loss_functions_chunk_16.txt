right again up to this point we have done all the computations and i'm trying to understand what should be.
the output function so that i get this shaded green part right so i've done up to a l and.
what should o be right so the choice of o that we are going to make is what is known.
as the soft mac function and this is how you write the softmax function and let me now explain what.
we are trying to do here right what does this function trying to say right so let's just look at.
an explanation of that so i can do it i need some space to do that let me just make.
some space okay so i can use this so now suppose our a l right this is a l okay.
now suppose it had again we had say in this case we were looking at a four class classification problem.
right so let's see it at a l the all the computations that have happened so far this is what.
my al vector looks like right suppose it's minus 10 10 20 30 right so this is what my a.
