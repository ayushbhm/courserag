to be favorable only if so only if this value is less than this value right otherwise it's not favorable.
I was at certain loss now I have moved and if the loss increases then that's not a favorable move.
right why I should have why would a better State there right so I would like uh you only if.
uh the new loss is less than the previous loss right so that's the condition that I want so what.
I want is that if I do the subtraction If I subtract the new loss from the old loss then.
I should get a value less than 0 which is a simpler I mean it's just another way of saying.
that the new loss is less than the Old Law so that's all I'm seeing right and now if I.
just look at this equation here what is this quantity so I just take L Theta to the other side.
and I am left with this right so what I am saying is that this quantity should be less than.
zero that's what I'm effectively saying right so I'll just delete some stuff so this is the quantity that I.
