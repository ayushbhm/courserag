1 and then I look at W1 and I'm going to compute the look ahead of the gradient in the.
next time step right so I've just changed the time steps a bit now notice in my new equations uh.
there is no WT minus one right everything in terms of t and t plus 1 so an easier way.
to look at this is that if you have a while loop if you put one step outside the while.
loop right then all your computations go like one step behind that right so that's that's what you are doing.
here you're just doing the look ahead before and then coming into the while loop so then you don't have.
to do the look ahead here and that is simplifying all your computations because now T minus 1 is nowhere.
here at this point you are not Computing a temporary value of w you are just Computing a new value.
of w at one go in the previous case you had to compute a new value of w twice once.
for the temporary look ahead and then one more time when you are updating right in this equation now all.
