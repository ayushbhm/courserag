have a very high weight for this and because the weight is high even though there's only one input which.
is on the weighted sum might still cross the threshold right and that's that's what the weights help you and.
that's the notion of importance encoded in an inequality right so that's where the weights are helping right now coming.
to the bias why is w naught called the uh why is w naught called the bias so w naught.
actually refers to the prior or the prejudice so what's the role that it is playing right it is one.
of the terms in the summation and it's like the blockage right so if w naught or or if theta.
is a very high value right so then your sum has started off with a very low value it's a.
high negative value that you have started off and now to cross this so that your total weighted sum is.
greater than zero all of these inputs will have to contribute a lot right that means many inputs may have.
