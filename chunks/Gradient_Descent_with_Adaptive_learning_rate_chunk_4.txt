X and the output y now if you wanted the derivative of the loss function with respect to W1 which.
is one of the weights in this network right so remember earlier we had derived when we just had one.
weight w we had derived this quantity which was the derivative of the loss function with respect to uh W.
and this is the formula that we had got and the only thing that has changed is that that time.
we had only one input which was X now we have four inputs X One X two x three x.
four so if you derive the formula this part which I have the under braces that would remain the same.
and it would just get multiplied by the appropriate input right the input to which the weight uh corresponds to.
similarly for the second weight W2 the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weight right so this.
would be uh so this quantity here is derivative of the loss function with respect to the weight W2 and.
