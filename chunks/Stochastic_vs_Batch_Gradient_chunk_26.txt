this mini batch size would be a bit dependent on the application that you're using and as I said in.
NLP when you're using Transformers some popular batch sizes are force uh around 4096 but it again there's nothing to.
memorize here or tell you this is a good value as you read papers and look at existing implementations of.
uh these algorithms you will understand what the right batch size is to use is all I'm saying is that.
in practice you'll use the mini batch version of these algorithms and there would be slight sensitivity to the bats.
size okay yeah so now again before going to uh some of the other algorithms which I want to cover.
I'll talk a bit about adjusting the learning rate and the moment right uh so uh so let's look at.
what the problem is.
