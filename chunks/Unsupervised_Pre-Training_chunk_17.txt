a more and more abstract representation of the input right so now again you have focused on layer H2 and.
made sure that this computes good representations that means you have cap and ensure that these weights that are sitting.
here are now some good or well initialized ways right so that's what you have done and now you will.
continue this process in the next iteration now you will freeze H1 and H2 now H2 becomes your input and.
now we will throw in H3 right and then you will try to learn these weights such that from H3.
you are able to reconstruct H2 perfectly right and you keep doing this till all the L layers that you.
have so you are learning one layer at a time and each layer is trying to learn some weights which.
are an abstract representation which give you allow you to compute an abstract representation of the input right so now.
this is what you are going to do so at the end right what have we achieved that all our.
