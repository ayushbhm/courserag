probability distributions so that's what you want to do in the case of classification so now let's fill in the.
glaps gaps suppose you want to classify an image into one of k classes here again we could use the.
squared error loss to capture the deviation but can you think of a better function right so that's the idea.
that's the motivation that i have set up now notice that y is a probability distribution where the two y.
is a probability distribution as i said all the mass is on the correct class and zero on the other.
class right that is something that you understand therefore we should ensure that whatever y hat we are going to.
predict should also be a probability distribution again i've already explained all this just re doing it so now what.
is the choice of the output function that you should choose right and this is what we have so far.
right again up to this point we have done all the computations and i'm trying to understand what should be.
