might find ETA not equal to 0.1 and that is perhaps always good or ETA not equal to 0.6 which.
is always good right now one more thing which I'm going to make an argument for now is that that.
is also not guaranteed so suppose you are in a steep region right so you are in a steep region.
so your history has been accumulating and suppose your current value of VT is 1.25 then what would your effective.
learning rate be it would be 0.48 right if the learning rate was set to 0.6 and if the learning.
rate was set to 0.1 then it would have been 0.08 right so same situation I'm just trying to make.
a case that depending on the initial learning rate your effective learning rate a Time step would be different right.
and since I'm in a steep region this is my preferred effective learning rate I want a smaller effective learning.
rate because I'm in a steep region and that I would have obtained if my initial learning rate was 0.1.
