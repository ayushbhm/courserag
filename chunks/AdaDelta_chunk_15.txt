were small right so the guy who is going to be behind which is U T minus 1 is going.
to look at smaller gradients whereas the guy who is ahead is started looking at faster gradients higher gradients right.
so that's why what is happening is that the magnitude of VT is large here and the magnitude of u.
t is small here because UT is still looking at the flat history whereas BT is one step ahead so.
it has looked at more uh steeper history than What U T minus 1 is looking at right therefore V.
T is larger than UT and since we were going in a steep Direction all the way around this is.
a favorable situation to have right we want VT to be larger than UT so that effectively the ratio is.
small and the learning rate is accordingly smaller right so that's exactly what we wanted and that is what is.
happening now I can show you uh this more clearly on the next slide where uh if you look at.
