as as opposed to only using the current grade unit so that's what the code is doing it's in line.
with the uh set of equations that you had if you want you can pause at this point and look.
at the code more carefully um but it's pretty uh straight forward okay so now let's try to run uh.
momentum based gradient okay and now you will see that right earlier it was very slow now it started moving.
very fast and it has gone like somewhere and it's coming back now whether that's a problem or not is.
something that we'll discuss soon but what is clear it's that definitely moving much faster than the gradient descent algorithm.
right and later on we'll have some uh comment on both gradient descent and momentum starting together and you will.
see the difference in one moving faster than the other moving slower okay but here it's clear that the momentum.
base algorithm is moving faster and we understand why that is also happening right let's look at the other view.
