adjusted in the network and maybe we have not really been adjusted very well so far and hence the output.
is bad right but then hl says that okay i am also part of this computation but i can't do.
much right because i am again as good as the previous activation layer after all how do you compute hl.
hl is again a function of the previous guys right so it's again a function of what these weights were.
and what were the inputs that got passed to those weights right so then again you go and talk to.
these guys so again the weights will say that hey we are fine right okay we made a mistake maybe.
we need to get adjusted we take responsibilities but these shaded red guys they'll again say hey what can i.
do i am a function of the previous guys so maybe you should go and talk to them right and.
then of course you cannot pass the responsibility to the input input is whatever it is right you cannot say.
