at bigger objects coming out from these smaller groups here all of these combine to make a face actually right.
so this is how each layer is processed doing a different job and each layer is also doing more and.
more complex processing or doing more abstraction of the input that was passed right so this is a very touch.
explanation of how the human brain works and that's the main takeaways here is that you have a massively parallel.
interconnected network of neurons there are many layers there are neurons which might do spatial things and then pass it.
on to other neurons and information flows from one layer to another that's the main takeaways as far as the.
deep learning course is concerned or as far as artificial neural networks are concerned right and as you can read.
the disclaimers on this on this slide i know i know very little about how the human brain works and.
whatever explanation i have given while is not suitable for any biology course it suffices for the purpose of this.
