need this bias correction I am just dividing the value of m t why this term 1 minus beta T.
because if I do that now this is actually my empty hat so now what this is telling me is.
that the expected value of empty hat is this same as the expected value of the derivative right so that's.
what I am doing this bias correction and you can have the similar derivation for the value of VT also.
right so that's why we have to use bias correction in Adam so that's the main point of discussion when.
we are talking about Adam right why do you need a bias correction all the other things in the equations.
are familiar one is related to momentum the other VT is related to decaying the learning rate in the denominator.
and again the vth self is an exponentially moving average as we had justified in the case of RMS prop.
right so there are no other unknown or New Concepts in the equation of atom but this bias correction is.
