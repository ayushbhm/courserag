can do this whether you have a one variable function or a two variable function of course three variable functions.
I cannot I'm just trying to get the angle right yeah this is what it is and you can see.
that the approximation is good so this is what the Taylor series does and you can do this approximation in.
multiple Dimensions also right so it need not be a function of a single variable it can also be a.
function of multiple variables okay um second take a pause here I'll let you reflect on this you could also.
go back to the lecture slides right the slides are also available on my web page and you can just.
go and try to play around with this digest this idea and then come back and watch the next video.
okay I'll just take a pause here thank you.
