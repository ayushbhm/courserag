zero that's what I'm effectively saying right so I'll just delete some stuff so this is the quantity that I.
want to be less than 0 if I take L Theta this side then that is the quantity that I.
get and that is just equal to this quantity right so if I want this quantity to be less than.
equal to 0 that means essentially I want this quantity to be less than zero right and I have omitted.
the ETA here because ETA is a positive scale right that's uh you we don't take a negative scalar there.
so ETA is positive so that will not affect so I can ignore ETA here and this quantity should be.
less than zero okay so that is what I have arrived at from the uh Taylor series and why is.
this why am I interested in this because this is a condition which depends on you right so now I'm.
what is being told to me that you have to select a u such that U transpose the dot product.
of U with the gradient Vector would be less than zero only then your U would be good so this.
