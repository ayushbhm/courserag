the derivatives along these three parts right I'm just going to apply the chain rule along these three parts and.
then sum the derivatives right so that's what you do when you have this kind of a situation this is.
just from basic calculus I've just revised that and now I'll just write this as a more compact formula right.
so this is the formula that I would write that if I want to compute the derivative of P of.
Z with Z such that there are multiple paths right there could be as many rights as such m paths.
such that I have Z I am Computing some intermediate quantities q1 Q2 up to q m using this Z.
then if I want to compute the derivative of p with respect to Z then it would be p with.
respect to q1 into q1 with respect to Z plus p with respect to Q2 into derivative of Q2 with.
respect to Z and I'm just going to sum all these parts that means there are M such parts and.
I'm going to sum the chain rule across each of these parts set and in any One path the chain.
