decaying it right so what is happening here is that you are having 1 over ETA 0 raised to KT.
right so at time step 0 suppose your ETA 0 is 1 right so at time step 0 and let's.
assume that K is also equal to 1. so suppose ETA 0 equal to 1 and K is also equal.
to 1 so time step 0 this would just be 1 over 1 so your learning rate is 1 and.
as the time steps keep increasing your learning rate will keep decreasing exponentially right so that's one simple thing to.
do but here the issue is that now what is the initial learning rate that becomes a hyper parameter that.
was anyways a hyper parameter but in addition this K and this K controls how quickly it will Decay right.
so if you use a very large value of K it will Decay very quickly right so you would see.
something like this if you use a smaller value of K it would Decay more smoothly right so now what.
is the right value of K that also needs to be determined so this makes it even more complex right.
