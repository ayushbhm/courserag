foreign [Music] Delta which avoids setting an initial learning rate completely right so let's see what it does so I.
have some n epochs or n iterations so I have Computing the gradient then I keep exponentially moving history VT.
okay then I do compute the update right so this is what my update is going to be right and.
that update is a ratio of two variables one is UT I have not defined what UT is yet but.
it's ratio of u t and VT of course the square root is there but there is no ETA naught.
here right so we still need to see what is UT and how does this ratio take care of the.
challenges that I was talking about yeah so let's see so UT then I update WT because I've computed the.
Delta which needs to be there right so that's uh this is simply uh yeah so this part is simply.
equivalent to I mean the equivalent of minus ETA naught divided by square root of beta into Del WT which.
I had in the previous algorithm and then my update tool was WT minus this right so this is my.
