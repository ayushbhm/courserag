foreign [Music] okay so we are talking about the problems with gradient descent and as you go along in this.
lecture we'll try to fix some of those problems but for that discussion it would be useful to understand how.
to draw contour maps because that would just make our life easier in terms of drawing the plots and so.
on and also Contours as an or contour maps is an important concept to know if you're doing machine learning.
deep learning and so on right so the idea here is this side that visualizing things in 3D can sometimes.
become a bit cumbersome right and so uh at least if images are static then you can only view it.
from a certain angle and so on so can we just do a 2d visualization of this traversal along the.
error surface and so to do that we need to know what are Contours so let's look at this right.
so now again we'll start with the 3D plot right so this is like a complex 3D plot that we.
