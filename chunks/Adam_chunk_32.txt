because of the large power of beta right and then it starts relying more on the recent guys and those.
recent guys are all farther away from zero so then it also starts coming close to the true curve right.
so that's why what happens if you don't use bias correction now the same thing if I had used bias.
correction this is what will happen right so now if I use bias correction then it gets divided by that.
one minus beta factor and then I don't have a problem right so in particular what happens right so I'll.
show you so my M 0 is minus 1 okay and my Mt is going to be beta into oh.
sorry m z sorry what am I seeing M minus 1 is 0 because I initialize it as 0 my.
history uh is initialized as a 0 then plus 1 minus beta into m t now at time step 0.
uh uh my value is 0.5 right so this uh yeah so this value is 0.5 and this term is.
going to disappear right so I'll get 1 minus beta uh into 0.5 that's what my Mt is going to.
