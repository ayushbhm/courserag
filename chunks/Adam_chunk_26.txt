to illustrate is that suppose I had computed the derivatives from the full batch right suppose the red function here.
is what my true derivative function would have looked like from time step 0 to time step 100 right but.
since I'm doing this mini batch version of the algorithms I'm Computing the derivatives from a smaller batch and hence.
I might get noisy estimates so you can see that every time step so this is the gradient that I.
computed at time step 0 this is at one this is a two and so on it's every Point here.
corresponds to one time step right so it's 0 200 so there are 100 points here right uh now uh.
as you can see that it's like kind of varying right it's uh not it's close to the true derivatives.
but also there is some noise right you see some up and down a movement there right and one way.
of dealing with this is to kind of say that instead of just relying on this gradient at this time.
