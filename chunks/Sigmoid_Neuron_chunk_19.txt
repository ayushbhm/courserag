this would become 1 over 1 plus infinity right so in that case the denominator would become Infinity so 1.
over infinity would be 0 and so as I go in this direction so as I go in uh this.
direction which is minus infinity my function starts tending to zero right so that's why this behavior is there and.
now again let's just do one more thing if W transpose X equal to 0 if I substitute that value.
then I get 1 over 1 plus e raised to 0. right and that would be half right so that's.
what you are seeing here okay yeah so that's that's what is happening here uh so for this discussion just.
let's assume that W 0 was 0 right so that this uh so that all of this is in sync.
right so that this is this disappears and all of this Falls in sync if you have a w naught.
you can have a similar explanation it's just that the graph will move a bit right so I'll leave it.
for you to figure that out but the what is the important thing is how do you get this s.
