so our approximation of the relation between x and y is called the model right so when i say that.
i have a machine learning model what does a model mean model means your belief of what is the relation.
between y and x right and it could be anything it could be this function we just saw this that.
why it does it satisfy the criteria that i have y is a function of x it also has some.
parameters okay what is this have you seen this before in machine learning in machine learning what is this called.
it's called logistic regression right this is the logistic regression model what is this linear regression you are assuming there.
is a linear relationship between y and x this is you are assuming there is a quadratic relation right any.
of this assumption is equally good or bad right now in deep learning you are going to we'll see that.
later on again you assume some f right and as the name suggests this f is going to be very.
