let's go ahead so i'm just going to uh as i said what i just explained that y hat l.
which is the same as soft max a l l is essentially this guy right so i've just put in.
the formula for that sorry this should have been i right because here the index is over i uh so.
i'm summing over all the exponents okay now this is the derivative of the form u by v or i.
can call it as derivative of the form g x by h x right and we all know the formula.
for that this is the formula for the derivative of u by v right and you would have again known.
this formula i will not go into the details of that you can refer to it if you don't know.
this just maybe quickly brush up some calculus and you will realize that this is the formula okay okay so.
let's go ahead now uh so i'm just going to supply substitute this formula blindly right so this is g.
of x for me and this is h of x for me so i'm just going to substitute g of.
x and h of x so this is derivative of g of x with respect to x so i'll have.
