weights are actually shrinking what exactly is happening here right I want us to pay attention to all of these.
so I'll clear these drawings because we understand what each of these plots corresponds to right now in the absence.
of regularization this is what your W was W star so that means it has taken this value along the.
W1 axis and a ticket taken this value along the W to axis okay so you can see that these.
W's are relatively large right now in the presence of regularization this is what my solution looks like let me.
just change the color so this is my value for W2 and this is my value for W1 so indeed.
my weights have shrunk right not just that my weights have not shrunk uniformly right it's not that W1 has.
become half its original value and W2 has also become half its original value you can see that W1 has.
decreased much more as compared to W1 right so first observation yes indeed my weights Shrunk the second observation that.
