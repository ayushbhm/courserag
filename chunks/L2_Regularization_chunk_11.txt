now I'm talking about second order approximation and what this says is that the loss function in this neighborhood right.
so w is the point in the neighborhood is the loss function at w Star Plus the first order term.
plus the second order right so you already know this from the Taylor series that we have seen earlier and.
now the interesting thing here is that this term is zero why is that zero because that's the optimal for.
the loss LW right and if it's the optimal for the loss LW then the derivative at that point is.
going to be zero right it's going to be some Minima at the Minima the derivative is going to be.
0 right so that's why this quantity is going to be zero I know I'm just going to expand this.
right so now what I have done here is this quantity has disappeared and this U I have written as.
W minus W star so wherever I see do I have substituted as W minus W star nothing great again.
