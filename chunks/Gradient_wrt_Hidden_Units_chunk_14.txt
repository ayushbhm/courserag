and this dot here means here I should have had the row index instead of the row index I have.
a DOT here that means I don't care about the row I'm going to take all the rows and all.
the rows from which column the jth column right so that is what this notation means I have the W3.
Matrix I'm going to take all the rows of that Matrix because I have not specified an index for the.
row but I haven't specified an index for the column so that means I'm taking all the rows for the.
jth column which is the same as taking the entire jth column right so how would I write that Matrix.
this is how I'll write this this is w 3 the first row jth column second row jth column all.
the way up to care through jfcon right so these are two uh matrices that I have now if sorry.
these are two vectors that I have I have still not shown why I came from here to here right.
that will become clear in a while why did I start discussing about these two just assume that these two.
