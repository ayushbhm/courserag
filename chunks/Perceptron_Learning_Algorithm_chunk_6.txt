had been set to 1 right so that is what x the bold x looks like it's a vector and.
similarly you have these w naughts to w n right which is the vector uh w okay sorry about my.
handwriting but i think it's kind of clear from the context what i am saying so this these are the.
two vectors so i am just going to take the weighted sum of w i x i and if the.
point was positive and if this weighted sum is less than 0 then you and i understand something bad has.
happened right because if the point was positive i wanted this weighted sum to be greater than zero that is.
what i have said here right so something is going wrong my weights are not the way they should be.
so i need to do some correction ok and this is the correction i am going to do i am.
just going to do w is equal to w plus x okay i am not going to say anything more.
about this at this point if the point was negative and if my summation was greater than equal to 0.
