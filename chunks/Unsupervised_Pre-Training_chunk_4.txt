ah ok so what we will do is we will take X as the input okay and we will focus.
on a very simple problem first right so this x is the input I have just taken the first hidden.
layer so I have taken the hidden layer as it is and now instead of feeding this hidden layer to.
the next layer I just disconnected the network and what I have done is I am now trying to predict.
X again right so think of this this way that I had say some 1 0 2 4 dimensional input.
then I have a hidden layer in between which is say 256 dimensional and then again an output layer which.
is one zero two four and my goal is to do the following right first compute this 256 dimensional hidden.
representation and then again reconstruct the output from it right and I my goal would be that if I call.
this x hat and this says X then since I am reconstructing my X hat should be as close to.
X right and that is what this loss function is calculating so my X was n dimensional so along each.
