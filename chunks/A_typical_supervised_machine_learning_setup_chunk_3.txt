do it for some thousand iterations for a fixed k i'll do it so what do you expect would happen.
at the end it could draw some line right now there many lines possible you could draw this draw this.
or this many things right so what do you think is a line a possible line here that it would.
end up with if i just run the perceptron algorithm just think about it okay i don't i mean it's.
hard for you to tell me what you're thinking but just think about it and then when i show you.
the answer just see whether you are in agreement with that sorry somewhere in the middle of the data and.
uh we all understand what he means by middle of the data right so let's see so this is what.
it would do in the upper case right where most points are i mean some there are errors i mean.
there's that's a hard problem given it cannot really separate by a linear boundary but it'll draw some boundary right.
in the second case also it will draw some boundary and here the situation is better as you can see.
