this idea was again not completely new there were very deep Learners proposed by schmidur in 191 1991 1993. again.
many things did not fall in place at that time right around that time internet was not what it was.
in 2006 and there was not like large tons of data available to you uh even storages at that time.
were much smaller and there's not enough compute available right so while this idea was there it did not fructify.
because the other conditions were not conducive right you do not have enough Computing of data to really train very.
deep models whereas in 2006 the compute was better The gpus had still not entered the scene at least in.
deep learning but still the compute was better and you had more data to train so that's why it worked.
well in that era right of course some other Innovations also but there was the basic idea was there earlier.
and then after this what happened right from the period from 2007 to 2009 once this spark came in hey.
