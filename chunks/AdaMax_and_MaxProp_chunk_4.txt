the whole thing I'll just do the necessary part now what I can do is I can take this X1.
by P outside right and let I'm assuming that X1 is the maximum value let's assume without loss of generality.
we can assume that X1 is the maximum value so this would become X2 by X1 raised to p and.
so on and you will have x n by X1 raised to p and then the 1 by P at.
the root of the whole thing right now as P tends to Infinity what will happen is as each of.
these quantities is uh each of these quantities is actually less than one right because X1 is the largest value.
so all the other quantities divided by X1 is going to be a quantity less than one so now if.
you're going to raise this to the power of P all of NP tends to Infinity then all of these.
terms will disappear right so then you'll just have X1 raised to p and then the pth root of that.
which will just be X1 so what you get back is just the maximum element that you had in the.
