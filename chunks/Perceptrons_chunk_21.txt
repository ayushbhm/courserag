greater than equal to 0 this is the positive half space less than 0 this is the negative half space.
so if i eq look at the line equal to 0 that's the separating line which is separating my inputs.
into this positive and negative half space right so let's see what that line is looking like so here i.
have this line so this is the line minus one plus one point one x one plus one point one.
x two equal to zero as i said earlier uh this is minus one right so this i already mentioned.
so that is why this is minus one here ok oh it is already deleted okay so now uh what.
is happening here right so the green shaded region is actually the positive half space of the line all the.
points in this half space will satisfy the equation minus 1 plus one point one x one plus one point.
one x two greater than equal to zero they'll satisfy that inequality hence there is a positive half space and.
all the points which are in the red zone and in my boolean world there is only one such point.
