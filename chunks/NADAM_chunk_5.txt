at uh yep uh yeah so instead of calling it GT GT in this case of course turns out to.
be Delta is of 0 itself but actually it would have been as if I follow this equation it would.
have been Delta W 0 minus ETA into beta into M minus 1 and this quantity just turned out to.
be 0 so that's how I am writing it here okay so that's what your W1 is now let's go.
ahead so if so this is where I have reached now now at G1 I am doing this look ahead.
right so when I'm Computing G1 I am actually looking at the derivative at a slightly further Point I've already.
moved by the history and then computed the derivative so that's where the lookup is happening right so that this.
is the point so now I'm looking ahead and Computing the derivative and now that is where look ahead happens.
in the original nag equation right and we are going to slightly modify that so now what is happening is.
that this yeah so now I have after doing the look ahead I have reached somewhere I have made that.
