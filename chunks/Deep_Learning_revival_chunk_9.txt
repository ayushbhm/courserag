of which it was hard to train deep neural network it's not just a com issue of compute right so.
there are three things that have changed since the 1990s right one is of course we have much more data.
now so if you have many parameters to train as a deep neural network would have you need larger amount.
of data that we have you need faster compute we have that but there were some other things also which.
needed to fall in place and that's what we'll focus on in this lecture right so it's not that this.
suddenly got discovered in 2019 and then people started using deep learning right so until 2006 it was very hard.
to train them and in 2006 there was a seminal work that I'll talk about which allowed us to train.
deep neural networks and that suddenly sparked or revived the interest in deep neural networks and from then on we.
have seen the success story which has led us to where we are currently in 2022 right so we will.
