and now if you're just stuck there and making these small changes to W you'd run the code for thousand.
iterations and you will see oh nothing is happening my loss is not changing my I'm not going towards a.
Minima and so on it will just be stuck there so you need to be able to come out of.
these situations right so this is one problem that you have with gradient descent that if it's stuck in regions.
which have a flat surface or have a very gentle slope then it'll take a lot of time if you.
perhaps run it for 10 000 iterations then it will come out and go to some slope and then take.
go towards the Minima right but then you might not have the patience to run it for 10 000 iteration.
so can we do something so that in these gentle regions the movement of gradient descent is fast right so.
that's the drawback that we want to solve okay so that's where we are headed and just to convince you.
that is not like uh I mean this is not a characteristic of where I started with and so on.
