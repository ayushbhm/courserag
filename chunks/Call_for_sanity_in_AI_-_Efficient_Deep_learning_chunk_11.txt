uh similar studies were done on facial recognition software and it was found people took the uh facial recognition systems.
from deep tech companies right microsoft ibm and so on and they found that if you are a white male.
then the facial recognition accuracy is very high right this corresponds to uh the second last column right so light.
no sorry the third last column which is lighter male right you are a light skinned or a white skinned.
male then all of these are giving you close to 100 accuracy if you are light skinned female then the.
accuracy decreases and the worst accuracy is for darker females which is the column in which you see the red.
bars and it's like atrociously low right so again this shows that the model has not really been trained for.
black women and hence it's not able to do a good job of recognizing faces of black right and the.
huge gap between the performance of the best category uh or the best performing category right versus the category for.
