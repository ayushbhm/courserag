this current value of the gradient right so instead of just looking at the current gradient I would have ideally.
wanted to look at the expected value right so remember that our true gradient is actually a sum over all.
the data points that we have right but here we are going to do mini batch or some such version.
and say we are doing stochastic in the worst case right we are just looking at one data point then.
I don't want to make decisions based on this one data point but I would like to be closer to.
the mean of the gradients or the expected value of the gradients right and this exponentially weighted average is also.
trying to capture some kind of an average right now the question is whether this exponentially weighted average is close.
to the expected value of the gradient right because I am taking a average and exponentially moving average is that.
close to the expected value because ideally I would wanted the expected value because that would tell me over all.
