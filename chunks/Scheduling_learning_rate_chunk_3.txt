it by the large learning rate and hence you see that there's this oscillation effect right so we don't really.
want that it's just increasing the learning rate is not really the solution always right and what we want is.
something which kind of adapts to the slope if the slope is small then you want a larger learning rate.
if the slope is large then maybe you want the learning rate to decrease right and this is exactly what.
we'll see in the advanced optimization algorithms which will be have an Adaptive flavor to them right so but for.
now I just want to mention that it's not just about increasing the learning rate you can't just set it.
to be of high value always right so that's not right so that setting the learning rate to a high.
value is not the right thing and then what do you set the learning rate to right so here are.
some tips so what we typically try to do is that uh at least so now just let me just.
