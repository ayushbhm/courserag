it is not okay uh this specific function that I've drawn is called relu 6 because 6 denotes the maximum.
value of the relu that you have here okay okay so what are the advantages of relu so it does.
not saturate in the positive region right what do I mean by that so as long as your A3 right.
was or a was positive the output would remain positive and it will not saturated there is no saturation here.
there is no clamping on this side as opposed to what you had in the sigmoid or any of the.
sigmoid shaped functions right so that is what I mean here but in the negative region it can still saturate.
right so in the if your contribution is negative right if the a is negative then it will be clamped.
to zero and of course the derivative would again then be zero right so it does saturate in the negative.
region so roughly half the problem solved but computational is of course very efficient right there is no exponent here.
