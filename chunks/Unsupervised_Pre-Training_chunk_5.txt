this x hat and this says X then since I am reconstructing my X hat should be as close to.
X right and that is what this loss function is calculating so my X was n dimensional so along each.
of these n Dimensions I want to reduce the error between the prediction and the construction and I want to.
do this for all the M training examples and I want to consider the average right so that's the objective.
function this is clear now what what am I trying to do here right what is happening here right so.
let us try to understand this conceptually that suppose I'm able to do this suppose I'm able to train a.
network which is able to reconstruct X hat with zero error that means I am taking an X I am.
doing a w x y that is a transformation I do then I pass it through a sigmoid function I.
am ignoring the biases okay so I get some hidden layer H1 right and then from the hidden layer I.
am reconstructing X hat as say W Times H1 okay this is what I am doing in this network right.
