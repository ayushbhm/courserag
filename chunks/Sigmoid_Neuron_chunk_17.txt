tan H function which is also a member of Islam right and let's see what is happening here so this.
is this is a quantity which is familiar to us right this is the weighted sum of the inputs and.
the threshold okay this quantity is familiar to us and we have been writing it as summation I equal to.
0 to n W naught X naught right it is the same quantity that we have been writing and this.
quantity we have actually been writing as W transpose X if you remember right where X is the vector from.
X 0 to X N and W is a vector from W 0 to WN right so this is just.
the dot product right so the quantity that I have underlined is just this quantity that we have been dealing.
with so far okay now let's look at this function a bit carefully so what happens when w transpose X.
tends to Infinity okay so this is as I go along this axis this is where W transpose X will.
start trending to Infinity rate because Z is what I've defined as double aspects X right so what what would.
