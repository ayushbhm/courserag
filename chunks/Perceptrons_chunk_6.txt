if the input value is small but the weight to the input is large then still the contribution would be.
higher right and notice that this index is over 1 to n because there are n inputs so from the.
first input to the last input right so 1 to n that's where the indices are coming from and it's.
going to be 0 if this weighted sum is less than threshold right so again a very similar form to.
the mp neuron now on the rest of the slide i'm just going to do some rewriting to arrive at.
a more neater form right i don't want to keep writing this let's see where i reach there so if.
i rewrite the above i'm just going to take theta on one side so this minus theta greater than equal.
to zero nothing wrong with this and minus theta less than zero right so i have just taken theta on.
one side now uh something interesting will happen so now the theta has disappeared looks like the theta has disappeared.
but actually it hasn't because i have added this i equal to 0 right so what i am saying now.
