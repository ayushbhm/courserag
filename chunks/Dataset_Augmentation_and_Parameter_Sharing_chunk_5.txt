the image right so what I'm trying to show you here and this is of course become much more clear.
when we do convolutional neural networks is that I have a matrix you can think of there's a matrix of.
Weights now instead of defining a separate Matrix for every part of the image I am going to use the.
same Matrix and apply it to different parts of the image right so that's the basic idea I'll not say.
anything more at this point because you need to understand what convolution is and so on and we will see.
this in more detail when we reach there right okay and also in the case of Auto encoders which we'll.
see after a few lectures is also known as something known as weight tying so what you do in weight.
tying is that if you look at this suppose this is n dimensional and this is D dimensional and this.
is again n dimensional so then the weight Matrix that you will have here would be n cross T dimensional.
