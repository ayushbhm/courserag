that other neuron to specialize for this training sample because it has not shown interest in this training sample right.
so one way of doing that is now I could take the max of these two so max would turn.
out to be a22 right and then when the gradients flow back right so now what is uh h21 it's.
the max of a to 2 and a21 which is equal to a 2 2 right so now if I.
take the derivative of h21 with respect to a21 and the derivative of h21 with respect to a22 then this.
would be 0 and this would be 1 so the gradient will only flow to this part it will not.
flow to this part right and that's what you wanted to achieve that you wanted to make this neuron specialized.
by giving it the signal and ignore this neuron because it was not really showing much enthusiasm for this input.
so let it not fire and I'll kind of ignore it and just try to make this other neuron specialize.
on this training sample and if you do that then in some sense your different neurons are uh kind of.
