of the decay right and it led to a paradigm shift in nlp uh which i showed in a era.
of like very big models very data hungry models and also pushed the boundary in terms of the performance of.
these models so within a couple of years of being introduced in 2014 people almost gave up on this phase-based.
statistical machine translation work which had taken 20 years which is 20 years in the making right in 20 years.
it dominated nlp and within a couple of years of these neural machine translation being introduced people even stopped comparing.
with those models and right now i don't think any paper actually even talks about these uh phase-based statistical machine.
translation that's the kind of impact uh that this has had right i mean just imagine like completely wiping away.
20 years of i won't say wiping i think that's a bit too harsh but kind of moving like making.
a significant paradigm shift right in terms of how things are done right and not just that right i mean.
