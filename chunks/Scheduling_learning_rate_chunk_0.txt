foreign [Music] descent momentum based gradient nestro vaccinated gradient descent and I know you are waiting for more algorithms Adam.
madagrad and so on but in between I took a slight D2 which is I went to the stochastic and.
minimatch gradient descent mini batch versions of these algorithms and we understood how they operate and before I go to.
these Advanced algorithms in today's lecture I want to do two more modules one is on adjusting the learning rate.
and momentum some tips for doing that and this I'll return back to this at the end of all the.
optimization algorithms once I finish all the optimized algorithms I'll revisit this part and the second module that I want.
to cover is on something known as line search right so both these are the two things that I've covered.
today and we'll end this lecture there and then in the next week I'll talk about some of the other.
