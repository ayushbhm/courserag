the face even if the nose detecting neuron is not active that means some other node needs to now detect.
how to uh I mean detect a face using ice let's say what the problem here is simple and I'm.
showing you an image and I want to tell you whether there's a human face in it or not and.
you can use the features of a human face to detect right so some neurons could fire if their eyes.
is there some neurons could fire if nose is there but now if you drop out things then some of.
these guys will no longer be available so then the other guys have to become creative and earlier maybe the.
network was never learning to rely on the eyebrows to detect a face but now some neurons will start picking.
that up because the other guys are not working so I better become more creative right so that way the.
network is becoming more robust right so that's all I had about Dropout and what I'll do next is I'll.
quickly give you a summary of all the regularization techniques that we have studied need.
