the derivative of this quantity with respect to W and this quantity is actually Alpha by 2 W transpose W.
so if you take the derivative of that with respect to W you can think of this as W Square.
so one of the W's will disappear and you'll have a two term here which will cancel with this so.
w square is the derivative is 2W so you the twos will cancel and you'll just be left with Alpha.
W right so that's that's how you can think of how we arrived at this formula right now ah so.
now what happens to your update rule right so your update rule earlier was the new value of loss is.
equal to the old value minus ETA times the derivative and now this is what your derivative looks like right.
and I've just opened up the brackets so this is what your earlier update rule would have looked like if.
you did not have the alpha term now since you have the alpha term this term gets added right so.
