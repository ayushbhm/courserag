what I had shown on the previous slide was good so even with ETA not equal to 0.1 the learning.
rate is still high right so the numerator is still high so this is now point one this is still.
high enough to cause the oscillations it's just that the oscillations are slightly better now they are between these two.
low loss regions right and when I change it to 0.05 as I had shown on the previous slide then.
it was better it was perhaps able to get here and then converge quickly from that point right so that's.
that's what the sensitivity to the initial learning rate is right so the point to note here is that everything.
else here is remaining the same right the Lost surface is the same the training points are the same the.
only thing that has changed is my initial learning rate and that is causing a difference between convergence and we.
saw three scenarios one where it converges one where it oscillates around a solution which is acceptable right so this.
