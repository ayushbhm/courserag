the hi's that you had all the edges these were your matrices these were the learnable matrices the transformation matrices.
WQ for query WV V for value and w k k for key and what you get out is the.
query Vector Q the value vector B and the key Vector okay right so for each word from your perspective.
for each word you have now been able to create three vectors from it right now how do you use.
these vectors how do you compute the attention is something that will come later on right but for now what.
we're doing is something simple right for whatever reasons we are taking one vector and Computing three vectors from it.
and these three vectors are being Computing with the help of linear Transformations coming from a matrix right so and.
these are learnable parameters so you have already introduced some parameters into the X okay so I'm just repeating what.
I had said on the slide and these are called the respective transformations now so now let's focus on uh.
