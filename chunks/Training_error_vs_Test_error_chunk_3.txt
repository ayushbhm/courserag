e of f hat of x minus E of f of x ah sorry the whole Square the expectation of.
that right so these terms are there in the bias formula these terms are there here also and there is.
a square here so if you open up the square by applying the formula for a minus B the whole.
square and then do some rearrangement of terms you will end up with this quantity right because this bias square.
is again going to be some square of this the variance again has the terms that you have on the.
left hand side so if you rearrange all of this you will get this and there is of course a.
formal derivation of this available online um which we have linked here so if you want to see the full.
derivation you can see this but what you can show is that the expected error on unseen data is actually.
dependent on the bias and the variance also so if you have a model which has a high bias like.
the simple model then your expected error on the test set is going to be high if you have a.
