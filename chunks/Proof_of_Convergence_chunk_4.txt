n minus is the negation of all the points in n right and now for every point belonging to p.
prime right which is the union of p and your n minus i want to ensure that w transpose p.
should be greater than equal to zero right so this is just sim just changing the notation so earlier if.
i wanted w transpose p should be greater than equal to 0 right and w transpose n which is an.
n is a point which belongs to the negative side should be less than 0 right but now what i've.
done is from every n i have constructed another p right which is just the negative of n so now.
every point in my data set has the output to be plus one right it has the output to be.
p right one sorry uh because i've just take the negative other point so for whatever point for the original.
point the output was zero so for the negative of that point the output should be one right so i've.
just constructed the single set which is a collection of all the points for which the only condition that i.
