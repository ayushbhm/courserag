is about translate languages right so this as you can see this is a period 1957 to 58 which is.
after the war and even during the war right i mean there was a lot of emphasis on being able.
to translate messages from enemies which spoke different languages german russian english and so on right and so translation was.
an important problem to be solved in that era and hence this was said that this will also be able.
to learn how to translate languages and today are almost like 70 years later right we are still trying to.
solve that problem very recently facebook has released a paper on which can do translation between 40 000 pairs involving.
200 languages but there's still a very long tale of languages that we still need to enable translation for and.
of course this is just initial flag planting in the sense that by no means are these 40 000 directions.
uh the translations adequate they're still at various levels of quality and much more is desired to make them really.
