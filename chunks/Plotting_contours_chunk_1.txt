error surface and so to do that we need to know what are Contours so let's look at this right.
so now again we'll start with the 3D plot right so this is like a complex 3D plot that we.
have here okay and now I'll start with this question right that uh if I were to take or let.
me just draw the contour map and then try to comment this question right so now what I'm going to.
do is I'm going to draw something which is called as a contour map corresponding to this 3D plot without.
telling you what a contour map is right so I'll just go ahead and draw it and then I'll come.
back and explain what a contour map is right so you can see what I've done here right so let.
me just point out a few things that have been done here so what I've done is whatever surface was.
given to me at regular intervals along the z-axis so let me just straighten this so that the z-axis is.
vertical okay whatever reasons okay this is good yeah maybe this angle is good so at regular intervals along the.
