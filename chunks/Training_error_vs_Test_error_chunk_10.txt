error that's what I'm going to do and this is for the N training points and then for the m.
test points which is n plus 1 to n plus 1 M points I can similarly Define the test error.
the average test error right so this is already known to you intuitively I've just formally defined it yeah so.
as the model complexity increases the train error becomes overly optimistic right because you saw that the blue curve was.
showing you or the training error is zero and you would think okay perfectly I've come from I have found.
the perfect relationship between Y and X but that's only for this training data right and as you as soon.
as you test it on the test data you will find the error is high and so what you actually.
want is that the validation error should be low right so the true picture of whether your F hat is.
really good comes from the validation data or the test data and not from the training data right you want.
