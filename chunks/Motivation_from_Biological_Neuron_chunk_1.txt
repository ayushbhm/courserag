so the inspiration actually comes from biology so i think you remember when we were talking about history we had.
talked about these biological neurons and the term neurons getting coined somewhere in 1890s which was the processing unit in.
the brain right and the idea is just as we have this neurons in the brain which can do fairly.
complex processing can we have artificial neurons which can also help us do some computational processing right so that's where.
the inspiration comes from so let's just look at what a biological neuron looks like so here's a picture i'm.
showing two neurons here i'll go through some important parts of the neuron so you have a dendrite right which.
receives signals from other neurons these neurons are connected as we had seen in the history again and then there's.
the synapse which is the point of connection of the two neurons so dendrite is the part from which one.
