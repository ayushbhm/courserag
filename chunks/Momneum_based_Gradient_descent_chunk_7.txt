beta times u0 plus the current derivative so now if I substitute the value of U 0 then it would.
be beta times Delta the previous derivative plus W1 right so this is what I mean by the history now.
you are not only considering the current derivative but you are also giving some importance to the past history right.
you are saying oh in the past also I was asked to move in this some Direction so I'll take.
that also into account right and Now Beta U2 would be beta Square into the derivative at time step 0.
beta into the derivative is time Step 1 and then the current derivative right so your updates remember are WT.
is equal to W T minus 1 minus ETA into u t right now this u t is essentially this.
right so it's not only the current derivative so at time Step 2 you're not just taking the current derivative.
but you are also taking all the history into account right so that's what is happening in momentum based gradient.
