like you see in this case but the more neurons you add it will be better right this theorem an.
illustrative proof of it is something that we will see but this was a real breakthrough right because now it.
has almost the reverse effect of what we had for the proof by pepper and minsky which said that even.
for simple functions a single neuron does not work now what this is saying is that for any arbitrary complex.
function not even boolean functions any arbitrary function that you have no longer what the function looks like you can.
always come up the neural network which will be able to approximate that function to any desired degree of precision.
right and that desired degree of precision is controlled by the number of neurons that you have if you're on.
fewer neurons my approximation would be very bad but if i keep adding neurons my approximation would become better and.
better right so this is a real breakthrough that was there and after this of course nothing changed right but.
