so that if i only retain things which are greater than one suppose i could have a way of filtering.
so that i could only retain things which are greater than one then only this part would remain right everything.
else is either one so this is all one okay and this is all zero right so if i have.
a thresholding such that i retain everything which is greater than one then i'll get my tower out of it.
does that make sense right so if i do a thresholding so how will i do that i can again.
introduce a sigmoid function there with a threshold of 1 so that the output is 0 till it reaches there.
and then it climbs to one right so if i have a sigmoid function which is a threshold of one.
or the switch over point set to one then when i take this output right so this is the output.
of some function right now let me just call it as h now when i take this edge so this.
is h and i'm going to pass it through another sigmoid okay such that it switches over at one then.
