Taylor series is only used in small uh Windows okay now that was one now let me just reset this.
okay and I change the function okay I want to make it the sine function okay and now this is.
what my approximation looks like now I'm going to increase the degree so this is a linear approximation right now.
right because I've just cut off the formula at the first order term now this is a quadratic approximation you.
can see that it looks better right the orange curve is closer to the blue curve right and now what.
I'm trying to prove actually is the uh utility of the Taylor series or uh how good the approximations get.
as you keep increasing the degree so this is a degree to approximation where I cut the formula at the.
second order terms if I cut the formula the third order terms this is what I get right and now.
you can see that in a very larger neighborhood also right the approximation is quite good right I mean the.
