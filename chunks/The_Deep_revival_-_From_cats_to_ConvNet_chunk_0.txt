foreign [Music] things were not working but now let's see if things start working so there this important contribution by.
Jeff hinton's group around 2016. now what you see here is a deep neural network of course by today's standards.
maybe it's a shallow network but at that time it was a deep neural network and even such networks were.
not being able to train by back propagation but they propose a simple idea right and we'll see this in.
the course where if you do something to initialize the weights of this network properly because earlier you are initializing.
the weights randomly and expecting back propagation to learn them but if you do something to initialize the weights properly.
then the training with back propagation becomes stable and you're able to train a very deep neural network of course.
this idea was again not completely new there were very deep Learners proposed by schmidur in 191 1991 1993. again.
