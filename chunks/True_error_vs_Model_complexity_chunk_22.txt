the model complexity by adding many parameters and many layers and that is going to give you poor generalization ah.
capability or poor or a higher test error that's why you add regularization so that you control for model complexity.
now what are these different regularization methods that you can use in the context of dipline learning is something that.
we'll see in the next lecture thank you so I'll end it here and I'll see you in the next.
lecture.
