so let's just uh look at that is it clear what I just said okay so now by using a.
parameter specific learning rate uh we have ensured that despite W being sparse we are still being able to move.
in that direction and also we have ensured that uh B is going undergoing a lot of updates but its.
effective learning rate is decreasing uh and there is this was something which is to ponder about which is not.
theoretically Justified now you could imagine that in the denominator I could have had ETA divided by VT as opposed.
to square root of VT right I would have got the same effect that my learning rate is inversely proportional.
the effective learning rate is inversely proportional to the accumulated history right but if you replace square root by just.
V T then this algorithm does not work so well and at least my guess is one of the reasons.
for that is that if you don't take the square root then these quantities become very large very quickly right.
