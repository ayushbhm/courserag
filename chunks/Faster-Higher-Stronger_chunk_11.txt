but the statistical machine translation models which were popular at that time uh were almost completely replaced by these recurrent.
neural networks and lstms right and then in 2017 came by what are known as transformer networks and we'll have.
a separate section on them later on which then slowly started replacing these rn and lstm it was but it.
took a couple of years at least for that transition to happen so i think around 2014 to 2019-ish is.
when this rnns and lstms which were proposed way back in 1990s and 1997 dominated the at least the nlp.
and speech uh scene uh as far as uh uh deep learning was considered concerned and then they were slowly.
replaced by transformers right and today we are in the era of transformers and we'll have a separate section discovering.
uh discussing the history of transformers later all right so i think i'll end this section here where we looked.
