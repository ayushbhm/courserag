input right so that's what the representation power of a multi-layer network of percept transfers now my goal is to.
make a similar statement okay and this of course I had we had proven by construction or we just constructed.
a network and we were convinced that it can actually represent any network irrespective of whether it's linearly separable or.
not right now my intention is to make a similar statement for multi-layer network of Sigma neurons right and the.
statement is a multi-layer network of neurons with a single hidden layer so far so good it's the same as.
what I see on the left hand side can be used to approximate okay now here are where the differences.
start so this was represent now I'm saying approximate right so it's that means it's not going to be exactly.
equal any continuous function this is good news right because here I was only talking about Boolean functions now any.
