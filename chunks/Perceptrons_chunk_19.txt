that's how my or function is right now let me just expand this right so what is this first guy.
is telling w naught plus w 1 into 0 plus w 2 into 0 should be less than 0 which.
implies that w naught should be less than 0. similarly the second equation is saying w naught plus w 1.
into 0 plus w 2 into 1 should be greater than equal to 0 which is just saying that w.
2 should be greater than equal to minus w naught right similarly the third equation is this is what it.
implies and similarly this is what the fourth equation implies right so i'll just take a pause for 10 seconds.
here so that you could just look at the equations and convince yourself that this is indeed the case okay.
now this is not the equations inequalities so these are the four inequalities given to me right and now i.
could just look try different values of w one and w two and w naught and try to figure out.
one combination of w one w two w naught which satisfies these inequalities of course in practice i would not.
