this looks like an astonishing claim right because i know that some of these functions are not linearly separable that's.
one reason why this is an astonishing claim because i'm claiming that even non-linearly separable boolean functions i can start.
the other reason why this is an astonishing claim is that this is like a single template i'm not having.
like a separate network or separate configuration for different boolean functions i have the same configuration the only thing that.
is changing is the weights of w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 if i change those values then.
i can implement any boolean function right this may look like an astonishing claim but it's not really if you.
really understand what is going on so what is going on here let us try to understand that right so.
each perceptron in the middle layer fires only for a specific input let's see why that happens right so as.
i said the red weights are minus 1 minus 1 okay now if the input is minus 1 minus 1.
