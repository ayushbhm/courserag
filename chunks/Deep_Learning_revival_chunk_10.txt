have seen the success story which has led us to where we are currently in 2022 right so we will.
talk about what happened in this initial years from 2006 to 2019 which kind of helped us train this deep.
neural networks and what was the effect of that and how is that connected to the lecture that we are.
looking at today right so that's going to be the focus so I'll end this video here and I'll come.
back and talk about unsupervised pre-training which is something that happened in 2006 and enabled the training of DPR Networks.
