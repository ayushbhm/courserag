and this is what the u-turns are what we saw on the momentum gradient descent right so it actually overshot.
right so it come here so it actually if you look at yeah this is what it looked like right.
so now uh so it went down in the valley now it should have gone towards its goal but it.
overshadowed the goal right it went further ahead then it took a U-turn and came back now again it should.
have gone somewhere here but its momentum carried it here in this direction and then again it had to take.
a U-turn and come back here right so that is what we saw so clearly it's moving fast but it's.
it's kind of moving a bit out of control right so we need to see whether if we can control.
the way it is moving right and so make let's see this in a more you know one more setting.
right so now we have this kind of an input and we have a very weird looking 3D surface here.
right and this is what the contour map looks like and now I'm just going to focus on the contour.
