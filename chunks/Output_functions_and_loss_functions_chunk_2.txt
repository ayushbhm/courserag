the imdb rating i have the critics rating and i have the rotten tomatoes it's all three are available to.
me and now using this input data right so this becomes my x comma y pairs i want to train.
a model which takes in as x as input right and gives me these three ratings as output which is.
the same as saying that it gives me a three dimensional output right so that's that's what it is now.
here i belongs to r3 as i said so now the loss function that we want should be able to.
deviate how much does the predicted value should be able to capture how much does the predicted value deviate from.
the true value right now here you have a vector as the true vector of true values and vector of.
predicted values and you want to find the difference between them so the obvious loss function would be these mean.
squared error loss function right so you have three values that you're predicting for each of these values you calculate.
