function you can go and figure out the conditions and the same thing will happen you will have only w.
one in one condition w two in another condition w three in another condition w four in another condition right.
and hence you can always satisfy this by adjusting the w one to w four in a particular manner is.
that okay fine so that is why since there are no conditions each input is being handled by a specific.
perceptron hence you can implement any boolean function in this case right and not just the xr function as i.
said you can implement any of the 16 boolean functions so for each boolean function you will get a different.
set of conditions for w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 and you can find some values of w.
1 w 2 w 3 w 4 which will satisfy that particular boolean function right so you can go back.
and try this out okay now what if we have more than three inputs can you think of the same.
template now and adapt it for the case of more than three inputs the same idea will repeat you will.
