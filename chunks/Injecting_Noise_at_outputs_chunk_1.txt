this error you can drive down to zero but now what if I do the following right so I instead.
of using this output the true output that was given to me uh and this is what my loss this.
is what I'm going to minimize right this is my cross entropy loss that I'm going to minimize so P.
here is the true label and Q is the predicted label so instead of using the true distribution what if.
I say that I don't trust the true labels they may be noisy or I don't want to trust the.
true labels because then I am trying to map my input exactly to the output and that is what overfitting.
is right so instead I am going to add some noise to the outputs what I'm going to do is.
that in my original distribution all my probability Mass was on the correct label right so what I'm going to.
do is I'm going to take away a small probability Mass from there and distribute it to the other labels.
right so now instead of all the mass being on one and everything else being 0 I'm instead of using.
