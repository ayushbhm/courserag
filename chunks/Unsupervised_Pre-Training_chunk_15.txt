have computed all the H1s using the x that was given to me and the training that I had done.
in the first iteration I had computed all the W's I was happy with whatever WS I have computed and.
using those W's I have computed H1 now as W times x plus C or B whatever we had used.
into that right so this computation I have done now I'm thinking of H I's as H1s as my input.
passing it through a hidden layer and then reconstructing H1 hat and again using the same objective function with X.
replaced by H1 right so nothing new that I am doing so again I'm just training one layer at a.
time right this is the only layer that is getting trained which means this is the only layer that I.
am trying to reconstruct right and now what am I doing I had said that H1 captures all the characteristics.
of X similarly now H2 is capturing all the important information of H1 so it's yet another level of abstract.
