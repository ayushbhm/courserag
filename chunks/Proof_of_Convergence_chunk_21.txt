cos beta is greater than equal to this quantity so i have simply substituted the numerator and i have substituted.
the denominator the simplified denominator and this would be greater than equal to because the numerator is greater than equal.
to this quantity and the denominator is less than equal to this quantity right so the numerator is greater than.
something the denominator is less than something so if i put the numerator over the denominator then the end result.
would be that cos beta is greater than equal to this quantity that you see here right so now here.
you have a k in the numerator and a square root of k in the denominator so which means i.
can roughly say this cos beta grows proportional to square root of k right and what is k k was.
the number of times i have updated my weight vector and this is the quantity that i wanted to handle.
on this is the quantity that i wanted to show was finite i wanted to show that k cannot tend.
