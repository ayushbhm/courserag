have when will that be high right this is a derivative so what does that mean that if you have.
a small change in the observation right if there is a small change ah in the observation then it causes.
a large change in the estimation right so if you are y i right so you are given this x.
i comma y i pairs right and now if there was a small suppose you are given the x i.
s ten and the Y I was 20 right and instead of that now if the X I was 10.
and the Y high was 20.1 this is small change right what this says is that if there is a.
small change in y i there is a large change in the estimated value right so you are now your.
training data has changed instead of this you had this point and now ideally you would expect that whatever F.
hat X you got right that means whatever parameters you estimated that shouldn't change much because there is a very.
small change in the data right but when would this quantity be high if this quantity is high it means.
