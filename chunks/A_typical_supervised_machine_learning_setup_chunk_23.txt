that means no point misclassified that means zero error now your objective function which is going to guide the learning.
algorithm has to be something about minimizing the error right how to do that what is error all of that.
we'll see in the subsequent slides right but that should what the goal be right and let's see yeah so.
the learning algorithm should aim to minimize the loss function right there is more to be said here but i'll.
not say those things in this slide we are going to come back to this slide again in a different.
form and then i'll say a bit more right so right now i think what should be clear is the.
data set up those three examples that i showed the model which is our approximation of the relation between x.
and y the learning algorithm which whole point is to learn w any learning has to be driven by an.
objective right so that the objective is to minimize the error function and that's what the objective is now how.
