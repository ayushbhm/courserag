saying then i need to make a correction as i just simplified my algorithm nothing has changed conceptually it's just.
that i've conveniently changed all the ends to n minus and then that's why all my points in the data.
become positive points that means for all of them the label is one now and then in that case i.
only need to worry about one condition right that's what i have done further for convenience what i'm going to.
do is that i'm going to normalize all my inputs i can do that right whatever inputs i have i'll.
just normalize them and that does not change anything because my original point was p and i have normalized it.
so it has become p divided by the norm of p that's what normalization mean and if w transpose p.
is greater than equal to zero then this is also greater than equal to zero so it does not change.
anything with respect to the conditions so it's a simple step which does not change anything conceptually for me so.
