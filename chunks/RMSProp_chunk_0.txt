foreign [Music] decays a learning rate very aggressively as the denominator Grows Right and we are allowing the denominator to.
grow inhibitedly because it's just accumulating the squares right so now uh frequent parameters will start receiving small updates so.
can we avoid this and prevent the rapid growth of the development right can we try to scale down the.
growth of the denominator and we know how to do that right and it's a simple uh thing that we.
could do is that instead of uh yeah instead of the original equation which was allowing the gradients to get.
added we can just take a fraction of the gradients right so now the typical value of beta would be.
say 0.9 so at any point you're just taking uh let me just get rid of this yeah so now.
you are taking 1 minus beta which is 0.1 times the current gradient and also the history you are repeatedly.
