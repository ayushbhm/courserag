have the points p1 p2 all the way up to some pm right these are all the points which belong.
to my p prime okay now i can compute the dot product between each of these points and w star.
okay i don't know what w star is but i can define the dot product i can say that this.
is the dot product okay and now what is dot product dot product is some scalar value right so for.
each of these i'll get some value belonging to r right some scalar value i will get now i can.
define the minimum of all these quantities okay right so let me call that minimum as delta so what is.
delta i have computed the dot product between w star and each of the points in p prime and whatever.
is the minimum value i am calling that as delta okay so what does that mean that any of these.
quantities here are going to be sorry [Music] yeah are going to be greater than equal to delta right because.
delta is the minimum value so all these values are going to be greater than equal to delta so that's.
