data points increases just computing this loss would be very difficult for all the infinite values of w and b.
right and here although i'm saying infinite i've actually plotted this only from minus 6 to plus 6. right those.
are the only values i'm not really plot i mean i cannot plot for minus infinity so what if there.
was a value here right going forward this side for which the loss was even lower right so what would.
what why i could have chosen that also right so this kind of just plotting the error surface and looking.
at it and figuring out the value that does not work in practice right even although this is a good.
way of seeing what is happening it does not you cannot do this in practice right you won't be able.
to get anywhere okay so now let us with that plot in mind and my guesswork in mind let us.
try to look at the geometric interpretation of what was happening in my guesswork algorithm right so we will try.
