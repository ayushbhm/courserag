lot of interest in that over the past few years the first models to do this were variation auto encoders.
and quite astonishingly right i mean if i tell you this at this point if you do not know much.
about variational autoencoders or any of these generation models you'd be astonished that they just take a noise vector that.
means they take a random vector as input and then generate real world images right so the images that you.
see here are generated by these models and none of these faces or none of these people actually exist in.
the real world right and you can see as time is passing by we're generating very very high quality real.
looking images right and this is all uh this these are innovations which are happening in what are known as.
generative models gans being the most popular of those i can see over the years starting in 2014 when gans.
were first introduced which is generative adversarial networks there have been a lot of innovations and improvements on that for.
