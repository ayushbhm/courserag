shallow or the gentle slope region and then again it will move slowly right and now I can just get.
rid of this 3D view I'll just work with the 2D view where I have the contour map I know.
what the loss is that the loss is high so this is color coded so whether for dark red means.
High loss functions the dark blue means loss low loss regions and there's a gradation from dark red to dark.
blue red so pink would mean somewhere in between and this is what the pink here is right and now.
it's moving on this 2D plot and I can see what is happening so now I have reached close to.
conversion so my points are almost on the sigmoid function and earlier I was moving very very slowly when I.
was at this point right and now as I am going to enter the value you will see a sudden.
change in my w and B a very large change in my wnb and the entire shape of my sigmoid.
function will change right and now I have entered the value I'm close to convergence and slowly slowly moving so.
