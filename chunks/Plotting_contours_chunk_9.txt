that the slope would be large in that region so let's see that right indeed the slope was sorry the.
slope would be uh gentle in that region right so whenever the slope is gentle the distance between the Rings.
is large and whenever the slope is steep for example here it's very steep right so in this region as.
you can see this if I look at the plot on the left hand side these here the slope is.
very uh yeah here the slope is very steep so the distance between the Rings is small here the slope.
is gentle so the distance between the Rings is large right so that's that's the idea captured in a contour.
map you could take there are many functions given here so I would encourage you to kind of go back.
and try out different functions right so this is yet another function I think quite uh complex and we can.
try to draw the contour map for that it looks quite horrible right but you could just relate it to.
