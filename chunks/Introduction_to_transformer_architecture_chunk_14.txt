be so I have these Alphas coming in here so for some reason the animations are showing up very slowly.
yeah so I have these Alphas showing up here and then I take a weighted sum and I compute this.
uh with a contextual representation uh C Wagner so this is called the context Vector it's also called The Thought.
Vector uh and for the rest of the discussion I'll typically call it the context Vector if I'm calling it.
something else I'll let you know uh at that point right so just think of this C1 as a context.
Vector which is a weighted sum or the attention weighted sum of the inputs right so you have just taken.
the outputs of the encoder which were these yellow representations which are context aware representations and now again to the.
decoder you are feeding a contextual representation which is now here the context is basically where am I on the.
output I'm producing the first word so what is the most important uh set of weights or what is the.
