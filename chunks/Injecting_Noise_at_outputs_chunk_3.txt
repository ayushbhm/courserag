to minimize is uh changing and that will act as a regularizer right because now you are not trying to.
minimize the true loss but a slightly corrupted version of the loss because you have made some change to the.
outputs right so that's what uh that's what you do in uh adding noise to the outputs and now since.
you are not what what you're doing done is again you have added some kind of a corruption to the.
loss function right so earlier you are looking at L theta plus Omega Theta right and now again if you.
open this up right and now again what has happened is earlier you had only uh so what you have.
now is Epsilon I Epsilon into log of P1 plus Epsilon into log of uh sorry P0 P1 Plus Epsilon.
into log of P3 log of P 9 and then you also have this 1 minus Epsilon into log of.
P2 which was the correct label right for the correct label this is the weight so now you can again.
think of this this was actually your true loss earlier without regularization right so you can think of this as.
