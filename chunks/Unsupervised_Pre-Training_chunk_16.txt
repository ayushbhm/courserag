of X similarly now H2 is capturing all the important information of H1 so it's yet another level of abstract.
representation of the original input right so this was already an abstract representation of the input which had discarded all.
the unimportant information and totally everything that you need to know about X and I can fully reconstruct X from.
here now H2 is an abstract representation of H1 which kind of captures every information in H1 and it's enough.
to cap reconstruct H1 from there so H1 is an abstract representation of x and it's to in turn is.
an abstract representation of H 1 so H2 is like a deeper abstract representation of X right so that is.
what you are doing and that's what the idea and a feed forward neural network is right every layer captures.
a more and more abstract representation of the input right so now again you have focused on layer H2 and.
