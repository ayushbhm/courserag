so that's why whenever you want to estimate the model so now you have trained the model and you want.
to see how good the model is it does not make sense as I'll show soon to estimate it from.
the training data because the training does is always going to be optimistic right as you keep increasing the model.
complexity it will go to zero but your test error might still be high and your test error actually gives.
you the true picture because if you empirically estimate the error from the test data then you are actually very.
close to the true error is what we have just derived.
