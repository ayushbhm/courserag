can learn all the parameters not just the threshold w naught but also w1 to wn are all inputs equal.
no now a perceptron allows weights what about functions which are not linearly separable so this is still not possible.
with a single perceptron because we have seen that the boundary is linearly separable the previous proof was also that.
it will be able to find the weights only when the data is linearly separable right but we'll see how.
to handle this and that's what this course is about that what if data is not linearly separable okay so.
i'll end this module here and we'll talk a bit more about linearly separable functions.
