it will get a change right so now you have added noise to the input and now once you have.
added noise to the input what is a deep neural network good at it is good at mapping x to.
the true y right that means it's very good at reducing the training error but now from this x you.
have given created a random X like a modified X or a corrupted X sorry not a random X but.
a corrupted X and now it is trying to map this corrupted x to the input right and now every.
time you see this training instance this corruption would be slightly different so across epochs as you are modifying the.
every time you are applying this noise process you are seeing a slightly different corrupted version of the original input.
and every time it has to map that to the same y so now again the job of the network.
has become harder because it's it's in a way similar to what you did with the augmentation of the data.
set right so you had an original two and then you passed it uh shifted to or rotated two and.
