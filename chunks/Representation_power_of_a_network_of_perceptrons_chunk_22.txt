this theorem is saying is that you can come up with a network of perceptrons which will exactly implement this.
function what does that mean is that whatever your truth table looks like and this is what your truth table.
is looking like right you can come up with a perceptron network of perceptron so that it will exactly be.
able to implement this boolean function so right this theorem says that you can apply this in real world examples.
the catch of course is that you will need an exponential number of neurons uh perceptrons and we'll have to.
get back from that situation right but for now we are happy in knowing that it can be done right.
now how to do it more efficiently is a question for later right so that's what this is uh saying.
same thing which has been written on the slides you can read it later on okay so what is the.
story so far the networks of the form that we just saw are called multi-layer perceptrons or mlps in short.
