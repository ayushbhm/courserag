i get here I just compute the gradient of that right so I'm doing the liquid in advance and then.
sending it to the next time step that's the idea that we want to get to is it making sense.
so this is what we will do right so now we had W1 if you look at W1 minus beta.
M naught right so this is W1 minus beta M naught which is effectively this so you have what was.
W1 the way you computed uh W1 was you had started with W naught minus ETA times this lookahead gradient.
that you had computed and then you did this minus beta M naught right this is what you had done.
to get the value of uh uh uh so this is what was happening let's say if I do W.
1 minus beta M naught this is what you will get and this already has this look ahead incorporated into.
this right which look ahead I was doing here what if I just do the look ahead in the previous.
iteration itself and when I'm Computing uh W1 what if I just put in this quantity also a over there.
