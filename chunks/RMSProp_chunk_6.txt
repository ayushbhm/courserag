solution right all the points were lying on the sigmoid curve but then the yellow curve started oscillating there now.
why does that happen is not clear but for this Slide the takeaway is that RMS prop converged more quickly.
than attack rad because it is being less aggressive in decaying the learning rate right that's the main takeaway why.
are there oscillations right so that is something that we need to understand right so one of the implications could.
be that maybe the learning rate is becoming constant and that is causing of oscillations right why the two questions.
to be answered here right why is the learning rate becoming constant and if the learning rate becomes constant why.
should there be oscillations right so these are the two questions that we need to okay so now recall that.
in adagrad uh this VT was uh sorry this should have been Square so this Delta WT Square should have.
been there and I when I had shown you the plots I had shown that VT never decreases right it.
