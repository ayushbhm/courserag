compute can you take your ai models and make them run on these devices right so that's another push that.
we have and a lot of things are being done to address these constraints of power storage you want real-time.
output so you cannot have like you submit a sentence and the result comes back after one or two seconds.
you want it to be in milliseconds right and what if you have drones which are not connected to internet.
right they're just stand alone can you do computations on the devices a lot of research is also happening in.
making these large models work for small devices so i do how do you take these multi-billion parameter models and.
make them smaller while not compromising on the accuracy right so this is all i had so i'll just stop.
here there are a few reference material here that you could look at but i'm done with the lecture i.
hope you enjoyed the history of course there are many other things which i might not have covered in particular.
