function is a smooth differentiable function and we want uh smooth differentiable functions because later on the hero of the.
course is going to be calculus where differentiability would be important right so that's the area so now i have.
defined an objective function and the learning algorithm should find w's such that when i plug in these values of.
w this loss value that i get should be as small as possible what does that mean there are infinite.
possible values of w right so w is an rn vector right it's an n dimensional real vector right m.
okay sorry m dimensional real vector and these are real values ah that's okay m plus one right that's okay.
not a problem uh so order m we can say right so m plus one because w naught is also.
there so this is uh m plus one dimensional vector which can take real values each value can go from.
minus infinity to infinity right so there are infinite possibilities here of those i want one such w which if.
