so probabilities lie between 0 to 1. so now this output of the sigmoid function we could interpret as a.
probability so now when it gives the value 0.49 I can say that there's a 49 chance that I like.
the movie earlier I was saying that there is zero chance I not like the movie when it outputs a.
value of 0.51 I can say there's a 51 so one person chance that I like the movie and now.
this makes sense right the difference between 49 to 51 percent makes sense right earlier it was 0 and 1.
when it was 49 and 15 so that harshness has disappeared now and more importantly I can now interpret these.
values as probability and this is something very important because in most modeling problems that is what we would want.
to do that you have to predict a certain binary value and you would like to predict it as a.
probability that this not harsh zero and one but this is a 49 chance of finding oil there there's a.
