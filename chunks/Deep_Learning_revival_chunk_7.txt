something that was discovered in the last decade maybe around 2009 2010 and then deep learning became so popular because.
we have been uh we I mean kind of know that deep learning has been popular since 2009 2010 in.
NLP maybe around 2014 and so on but in the last decade right so is it that around that time.
this algorithm got discovered and then we all started switching to deep neural networks no actually right so the back.
propagation algorithm existed much before anything late 70s or even before that if for all I know but I definitely.
know that in 90 1986 there was this it was made popular in the context of neural networks by rumala.
heart and team right so it has existed for a long time so what was happening since from 1986 to.
2009 2010 when deep learning became really popular right why was deep learning not so popular in the 90s or.
early 2000s given that the algorithm used for training it existed back then right so what was stopping it from.
