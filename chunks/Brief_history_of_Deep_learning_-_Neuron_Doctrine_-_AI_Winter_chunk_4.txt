using that chemical reaction he analyzed a slice of the nervous tissue and he came up with the same conclusion.
that actually this nervous system is like one continuous network and it's not composed of discrete units so he was.
also a proponent of reticular theory right and he his evidence for that was through the staining technique but quite.
interestingly around the same time uh santiago i won't pronounce the full name because i can't use the same technique.
the same straining technique which uh golgi had come up with right and by making similar observations using the same.
technique but maybe seeing things a bit differently he came up with the conclusion around 88 and 1888 1891 time.
frame that no actually the nervous system is made up of discrete individual cells forming a network right so two.
different uh prominent theories at that time one says that it's a single uh network the other says that it's.
