is important it's a contextual representation is important what is not good is in the interest of doing this contextual.
computation I'm not being able to do a parallel processing I have to wait every time one word at a.
time which is significantly which reduces my computational efficiency right because I am just doing things sequentially right so now.
my wish list would be to be able to do this to get the contextual representation that means when I'm.
Computing the yellow box for the word movie I want to know what is happening around me I want to.
take inputs from the other words and right now these inputs are flowing through these hidden represent additions at 0.
H1 h2h3 so I want that to continue right and of course I'm going bi-directional so it's flowing from both.
sides so I want that to happen I want to take the inputs from all the surrounding words but I.
don't want to do this in a sequential manner I want a model which is not recurrent in nature because.
