interested in knowing the weights of all the input words now with respect to my query or by my first.
word or my word of focus I want to know the weights of all the other words so that word.
is going to remain fixed I'm going to have q1 and I'm going to compute capital t such values right.
so each telling me the importance of the first word second word third word fourth word fifth word right notice.
that I'm also Computing the importance of the word itself right that also I'm doing so q1 with respect to.
K1 K2 K3 K4 K5 right so q1 with respect to K1 K2 K3 K4 K5 so these five scores.
I'm going to compute and maybe I'll call them as is okay uh now the function that I'm going to.
use is just the dot product like what is the scoring function my scoring function is just dot product so.
my E's which are the unnormalized attention weights are just going to be the dot product between q1 and K1.
Q2 and q1 and K2 q1 and K3 all the way up to q1 and K5 right so as I.
