I come here okay it's still running okay so when I came here let's see okay now let me just.
annotate this right so in this region I was moving very very slowly and you can uh okay so in.
this region I was moving very slowly and you can see here the the change in wnb was so small.
that the two consecutive points were so close to each other that they're almost seeming connected right that's what is.
happening at the bottom and then when here in this region when I went inside the valley right so I.
was at the plateau at the top you can see that now my w and B are changing fast right.
so maybe it's not visible clearly now let me just uh so you know which region I want you to.
look at so now let me just try to expand this or rather make maximize this right so this region.
here is what I want you to look at and you can see that now my w and B are.
actually I mean the every new W comma B point is actually farther away from my previous W comma B.
