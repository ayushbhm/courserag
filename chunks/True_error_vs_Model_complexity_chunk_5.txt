if you look only at the empirical estimation from the training error then you are being very optimistic because you.
are ignoring a large quantity but now why does this quantity depend on the model complexity right that is something.
that we have not seen so that is what we will see next okay so now we will ah try.
to wrap up the discussion on bias variance by talking about how the true error is actually uh what's the.
relation between the error and the model complexity right so this was the quantity that was bothering us right this.
was a quantity which did not go to zero in the case when we're trying to estimate these expectations from.
the training data and then it ah that meant that if you just compute the empirical training error then you.
are missing out on things right you are not really ah giving a true picture of the true error right.
so this was the quantity that was bothering us and now this quantity again I could think of it uh.
