the derivative across all these inputs at this we have again done some before so the the derivative of w.
derivative of the loss function that will secure W 2 would be summation I equal to 1 to M right.
and then uh you will have this entire quantity inside and in the end that would be multiplied by x.
2 of the appropriate I right so that's what the derivative would look like right so uh maybe this is.
not clear here let me just undo that yeah so you'll have this so you'll have this term which is.
in the bracket and then multiplied by x 2 of the corresponding input right so that's what the total derivative.
would look like right so you're just the derivative of the loss function with respect to W2 is going to.
the sum of this quantity that I have shown here okay now now what happens if a feature X2 is.
passed right so X2 is one of the features so in our oil drilling example it could be salinity pressure.
