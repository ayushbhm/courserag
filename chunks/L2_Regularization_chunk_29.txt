Here Right foreign transpose W Star right so this is the first multiplication that is happening now each element of.
that Vector is getting scaled scaled by this quantity right and after it gets scaled by that quantity it is.
rotated back by q that is what is happening right the rotations performed by q r transpose and Q R.
inverses of each other but in between this scaling is happening right and now if the eigen values is very.
large if it's greater than Alpha right then this quantity that you have on the diagonal is actually going to.
be equal to 1 right so a lot that means for those weights there will be no scaling which will.
happen they will remain the same as their original value right so remember this W star is a vector of.
weights and we are talking about every element of that Vector getting scaled but we're just seeing that if the.
eigen value is large then those weights will not get Scaled let's suppose Lambda 1 was very large then nothing.
