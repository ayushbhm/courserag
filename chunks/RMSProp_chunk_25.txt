steep regions your history was also high and your current thing is also high so your VT will keep increasing.
right and now when you enter regions where you are in a flat region then over a period of time.
this VT will become flat right because now your history is contributing history's importance is gradually decreasing because of the.
beta factor and your new stuff is very small to make a difference till it reaches a point that you.
start seeing a Tipping Point right now your his this new factor is very small and your history is also.
diminished significantly because the initial higher gradients are now multiplied by a very large power of beta right so that.
initial history has diminished and your current gradients are very small when you are close to the Minima or to.
the flat surface so then as we had said right the is history can then start decreasing right so this.
