times what does that mean that this is what I mean by that right so in this model let us.
try to understand what my full procedure looks like right so I have my loss as I equal to 1.
to M where as m is the number of training points and in this case I am going to Define.
my loss as y i which is a true y that was given to me minus F hat of x.
i which is my function that I have chosen right and the parameters here are all the W's that I.
have right it's either so this is a minimization problem with respect to the W's so the W's are either.
W 1 and W naught or they are W 25 all the way up to W 29 right and this.
you know now how to solve this or how to ah find this Minima using the gradient descent or any.
of the variance of the gradient descent algorithm right now let us consider the simple model which was W 1.
x 1 plus W naught right so at the end of training suppose I I took some ah 400 points.
