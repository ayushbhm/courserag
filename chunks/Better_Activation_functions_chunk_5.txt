said we have already discussed this but I just wanted to quickly refresh it because it's relevant for the discussion.
so now if the power of deep neural networks comes from such non-linearities where do the nonlinearities come from the.
non-linearities essentially come from the activation function and hence we need to discuss about these activation functions and what do.
these bring and are there better activation functions possible is is any non-linear function okay or we want certain better.
and better properties should be satisfied by these nonlinear functions so that's what we are going to focus on today.
right so that's the reason why our discussion on activation functions is important right now we look at some of.
the popular activation functions the quite a bit of this material at least the initial part is taken from the.
lecture like a few years back uh lecture slides from Andre carpathy's course I'm not sure if that those videos.
