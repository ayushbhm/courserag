horizontal axis is the W axis and my vertical axis is the B axis as has been appropriately labeled on.
the plot right now with that information can you tell me what peculiar behavior is happening here okay good so.
what what you're saying is this right that uh I mean as I say it it looks like these algorithms.
went to a school where no one taught them greed in descent or no one taught them Pythagoras Theorem right.
so what what I mean by that is uh if you look here uh initially all the three algorithms are.
moving in the direction of B right they are not they have moved only till this point right till this.
year they've moved only little bit in the direction of w right so till this point is where they have.
reached so they have not much move from the initial value of w right but where they have moved a.
lot in the direction of B right and that is expected because B was the dense feature hence its gradients.
