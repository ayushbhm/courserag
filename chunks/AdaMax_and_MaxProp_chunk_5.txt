terms will disappear right so then you'll just have X1 raised to p and then the pth root of that.
which will just be X1 so what you get back is just the maximum element that you had in the.
vector right so that's why LP Norm the L Infinity Norm is just like taking is equivalent to taking the.
maximum value and that's all we need to do right so that's that's easy to compute there's no numerical instability.
there right so that's uh that's an interesting result okay so now we understand about LP Norms in general and.
we understand about L Infinity which is just taking the maximum value right now what is the point that we're.
trying to make here right so recall the equation of VT this was the equation of VT that we had.
and this was as we had seen equivalent to doing right uh beta so what if I just expand this.
right then what we had seen was we are doing uh beta 2 uh raised to at time step T.
right so T minus 1 into Delta W 0 squared Plus beta 2 into T minus 2 Delta W 1.
