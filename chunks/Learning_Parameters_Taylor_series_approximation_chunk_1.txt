minimum quickly and without a lot of back tracing or like going back or not back racing actually but random.
jumps here in there which don't necessarily decrease the error at each iteration right and we don't want to do.
this brute for search either right so that is not possible right we cannot plug in all the values of.
the parameters and then see that value which gives us the minimum value that would be the Brute Forces we.
cannot do that and we have argued why that is infeasible there are infinite values there okay so let's look.
at the setup now right so we have our parameters in the toy Network where W comma B and I'm.
just going to put them in a array or a vector and call that Vector as Theta right so now.
Theta is my parameter of vectors and now I'm looking for changing this value right so just as is always.
the case I don't know what the correct Theta is so I'm going to start off with some random value.
