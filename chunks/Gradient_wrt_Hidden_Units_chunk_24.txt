just trying to compute the derivative of this with respect to a i j I'm just going to call that.
as G Dash right because it could be any function but I am just taking the derivative so this is.
what it looks like this guy I have already computed this is just G Dash a i j right so.
now again from this one element let me go to the entire Vector so now I want the derivative of.
the loss function with respect to a i the entire Vector so it is again going to be a collection.
of the partial derivatives and every element I know how to compute so I have a formula for a i.
j so now I will go from AI 1 all the way up to a i n I'll just substitute.
J equal to 1 to n everywhere in the formula and this is what I get right so this is.
one vector that I have I could think of this as another Vector this is not the dot product between.
two vectors right because the dot product between two vectors gives me a scalar this is the element wise multiplication.
