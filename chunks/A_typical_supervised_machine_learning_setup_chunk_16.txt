comma y pairs here if i just had 2 x comma y plus then i could predict the values of.
w and p right i could find out the values right and from that i just want you to extrapolate.
your belief and say that if you have many data points and many parameters you could come up with algorithms.
to find the values of these parameters okay in this case our algorithm was simple let's just construct a simultaneous.
equation and solve that simultaneous equation right but you could extrapolate this idea and you could say that if you.
have many data points given to you where the values of y and x are known and now you have.
some parameters to find you could estimate these parameters from the data okay so that's the game in machine learning.
there are few more details i'll now erase this whatever i have here and go into those details okay okay.
so our approximation of the relation between x and y is called the model right so when i say that.
