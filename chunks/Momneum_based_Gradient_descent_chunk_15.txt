almost reached there but then again it has moved far and then again come to something which is some things.
are happening here which many of you might be realizing that it's oscillating around the solution and we'll see why.
that is happening and how to fix that right what is clear for now is that it's moving faster than.
gradient descent right so some observations and questions even in the regions having gentle slopes momentum based gradientation is able.
to take large steps because the momentum carries it along right because it is having the entire history behind it.
it just goes faster now but is moving fast always so good right would there be a situation where momentum.
would cause us to run past our goal right and again I'll go back to my analogy so you're going.
towards the Phoenix Market City a lot of momentum has been built many people have asked you to go in.
the right right right right and now suppose imagine you are on a scooter because now you are fast and.
