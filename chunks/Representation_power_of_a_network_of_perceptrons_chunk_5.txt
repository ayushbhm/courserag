hidden layer i am denoting them as h1 h2 h3h4 the output of the final layer i am denoting it.
as y and the red and blue edges are called the layer 1 weights and w1 w2 w3 w4 are.
called layer 2 weights okay so there are two layers one hidden layer one output layer and i'm not counting.
the input layer because it's there right so this layer one weights are called the red and blue edges are.
the layer 1 weights and w 1 w 2 w 3 4 are the layer 2 panes okay this is.
all definition all terminology now is the interesting part i'm going to claim that this network can be used to.
implement any boolean function whether that function is linearly separable or not what does that mean it means what i'm.
trying to say is that i can i have this generic template which has now four weights w1 w2 w3.
w4 everything else in the network has been hard coded right the only four variables are w1 w2 w34 using.
