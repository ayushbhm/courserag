very small and you'll be making these tiny tiny updates W and take a long time to move away from.
that flat surface right so imagine like a very flat surface which is quite big right in terms of the.
W comma B neighborhood that it spans then you'll be stuck there for a very very very very long time.
right before you move to some favorable region where you see a slope and then you start going towards the.
Minima right and it could happen that you run so we remember we had sent said this Max iterations as.
thousand so it could happen that you are running your algorithm for thousand iterations but you are not seeing any.
dramatic change in the loss because indeed you are on this flat surface where the loss is more or less.
constant or very gentle slope right it's decreasing from say maybe 0.9 to 0.8999999 over a very long distance right.
and now if you're just stuck there and making these small changes to W you'd run the code for thousand.
