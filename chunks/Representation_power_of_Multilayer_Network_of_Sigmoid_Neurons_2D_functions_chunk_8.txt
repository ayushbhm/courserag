minus h2 and if i were to hide the other things then i'll get a tower function right again the.
same logic that i'll not show you this right so here both are oops yeah maybe this is fine yeah.
this looks better yeah so here both are 0 so the output will remain 0. here both are 1 so.
1 minus 1 is going to become 0 so it will become flat and here this is 1 and this.
is 0 so 1 minus 0 so you'll get a tower like this right so that is now if i.
hide h 1 1 and h 1 2 and only show you h 1 1 minus h 1 2 then.
it's going to look like this tower right and let me just delete some of the okay right so this.
is looking like a tower so i have been able to construct a tower but this is still not complete.
right because this tower is like open from two sides i don't want a tower which is open from two.
sides i want a closed tower right just as that 2d thing where you had a tower like this i'd.
want a tower which is closed from all the four sides right now right now it's open from two sides.
