happening now I can show you uh this more clearly on the next slide where uh if you look at.
the learning rates for Ada Delta and RMS prop then RMS prop it constantly decreases right because it does not.
have any adaptive nature as it uh kind of uh it has to keep uh decreasing because it's one over.
the accumulated uh history in this case and since the history was always steep whereas in other Delta you see.
some kind of adoption happening adaptation happening and overall Adar Delta is able to converge faster on the plot that.
we had see wow yeah so let's look at some of these values also so here we had set the.
initial learning rate to 0.013 so this curve is 0.013 divided by the square root of whatever and this both.
started at Point 20 right that's the uh what the initial value was but this only decreased up to 0.12.
and hence it was able to kind of converge faster whereas this was 0.05 and then it became uh uh.
