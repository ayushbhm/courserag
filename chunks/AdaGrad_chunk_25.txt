right that's why it reaches very high digits right it treats reaches five digit numbers and that's why your learning.
rate gets killed off aggressively right because your denominator has now become five digit number right the square root of.
a five digit number okay and that's again in line with what the intuition that we had right so these.
plots are again an explanation of everything that we saw right we're just seeing how the learning rate is changing.
how the gradients are accumulating aggressively in the case of B and hence the learning rate is decreasing aggressively right.
and the main main point is that in B the learning rate started off itself with 0.010 and then kept.
decreasing from there whereas for w the learning rate started off with 0.72 which was higher than the ETA which.
I had said and then started out decreasing from there and that's exactly what we wanted because W is a.
