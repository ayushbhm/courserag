the probability offense right so let's see what happens when we have k equal to 25 and we'll compare k.
equal to 25 versus k equal to 1 right so let's see that okay so we are going to run.
gradient descent stochastic gradient descent and mini match gradient descent where the batch size was 25 and what I would.
like to see is that the mini batch gradient descent is somewhere in between that green curve and the black.
curve right in terms of movement and you'll understand what I mean by that so let's start this so you.
can see that the blue curve is very close to the green curve whereas the black curve is oscillating quite.
a bit more right of course the blue curve uh which is for mini batch also has oscillations is just.
that it's much more smoother than the black guy because the black guy relies on one point and makes an.
estimate whereas the blue guy is relying on 25 different points and making an estimate okay yeah so the oscillations.
