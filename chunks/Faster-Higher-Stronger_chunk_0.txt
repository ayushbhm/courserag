[Music] now so where are we in the history right we did a bit of back and forth so we.
came from the 1950s where there was enthusiasm then the and the spring period then the winter period then the.
more stable period where people were still looking at things there were some success in the 1990s in terms of.
convolutional neural networks actually being used for real world problems and but still some disappointment in terms of very large.
networks not being able to train despite back propagation being known and universal approximation theorem being understood right and then.
2006 around that time these things changed and then from 2006 to 2012 a lot of other advances happened which.
gave us a better understanding of deep learning and we were able to train these networks to work for the.
image net and similar challenges and started showing uh again it's not just gain but starting winning some of these.
