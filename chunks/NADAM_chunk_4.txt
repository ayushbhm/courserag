here it'll just screw it on the plot so that's where you have computed the derivative then at m0 uh.
since you have remember that we have kept the learning rate as one I have initialized it here in the.
top right corner here right uh so ETA is equal to 1 and of course n minus 1 is 0.
at time step minus 1 you don't have any history so here m0 is going to be beta times 0.
plus G 0 so it's just going to be G 0 so far so good and then W1 is going.
to be W 0 minus uh let me just choose the pen so I'll just do this once so there.
should have been an ETA here but ETA is set to 1 that's why I'm not using ETA right so.
remember that ETA is always there in all all the stuff that I'll do in the next two slides is.
just that the value of ETA is equal to 1 right and then you w 0 minus the derivative computed.
at uh yep uh yeah so instead of calling it GT GT in this case of course turns out to.
be Delta is of 0 itself but actually it would have been as if I follow this equation it would.
