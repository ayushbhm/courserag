and the distance between the Rings right so now that we understand what contour maps are right let's try to.
do this we will revisit uh the gradient descent algorithm and now try to explain in terms of the movement.
on the contour map right so this was my uh 3D plot and what you see here and here is.
the corresponding contour map right and you can see that in this region which corresponds to this region here the.
slope is very gentle hence the distance between this contour line and the next contour line which is not even.
visible is very large right and here right as I am going into the valley as I'm going into the.
valley you can see that all the contour lines are very close to each other because the slope is very.
steep there again here as you can see the here the slope is gentle so the distance between the contour.
lines is high but as I keep coming down the slope becomes sharp and my distance between the contour lines.
