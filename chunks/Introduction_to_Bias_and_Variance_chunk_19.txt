give me a zero error on the training data itself whereas complex models are able to overfit they are giving.
me close to zero error on the training data at least some of them on average are giving me close.
to zero error on the training data right so this is what is happening now so now what I have.
drawn here I have the red curve which is my true sinusoidal function then the green curve that you see.
that is the that is the average value of x hat for the simple model so what do I mean.
by that what do I mean by that so I have computed 25 different models right I have each of.
these models now I plug in a value of x into each of these models okay and I get y's.
from each of these models right now I take the average value of that Y and I plot it so.
if I plug in x equal to 0 I compute ah sorry there were 30 models not 25 right so.
I compute ah F hat of x from all the 30 models and then take the average and plot it.
