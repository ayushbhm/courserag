the synapse which is the point of connection of the two neurons so dendrite is the part from which one.
neuron receives signals from the other neurons and the point of connection is called synapse and then you have soma.
which is the kind of you could think of with the central processing unit where all the information gets processed.
and then you have the axon once the information has been persist the exon is responsible for uh carrying it.
out to the other neurons right so dendrite to receive signals then synapse is the point of connection between neurons.
soma is where the processing happens in the neurons and exons is where you give the output out or transmit.
the output to the other neuron so this is what a biological neuron looks like right and let's see like.
a very cartoonish illustration of how this uh works and how a neuron works right so our uh sense organs.
they interact with uh the outside world right so we see we hear and so on so now let's assume.
