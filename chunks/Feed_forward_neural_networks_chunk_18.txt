have alx right so this is your free activation at the output layer and i'm going to use a sum.
spatial function right so i have called g as the functions for the hidden layers the activation functions for the.
hidden layers but for the output i'll need some spatial function right so i'll tell you give you some intuition.
why so example i cannot always use the sigmoid function at the output because the sigmoid function will only give.
me values between 0 to 1 whereas in some cases my output could be greater than that so what if.
i am trying to predict say the rating of a movie on a scale of 0 to 100 or the.
score of a test on a scale of 0 to 100. if i bound it to sigmoid function then it.
will only give me values between 0 to 1. so depending on the problem that i'm handling i would want.
some output functions which allow me to cover those range right so we'll do that in more detail in this.
