and we had this intuition that training error as computed from the training data this is the empirical training error.
is actually very over optimistic because it does not consider this other quantity sitting here right and test error is.
not optimistic because in that case this quantity disappears so whatever you get from the test error is actually very.
close to the true error that you might get from the expectation but now how is this related to ah.
model complexity right so I said that there is when you are trying to estimate it from the training error.
this quantity sits here but then I also said that as your training model complexity increases your training error is.
overly optimistic what does that mean that as your model complexity increases this quantity is actually very high and hence.
if you look only at the empirical estimation from the training error then you are being very optimistic because you.
