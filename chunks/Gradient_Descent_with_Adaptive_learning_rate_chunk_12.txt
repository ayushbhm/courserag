so that's the overall idea yeah so that's what is happening here now why is this important right so my.
uh my weight now you might say that if this feature is passed then why do I care about it.
right I mean let it not get updates let those weights not get updated because then maybe this feature will.
not contribute much to my final classification but that's not the case right so there could be a case that.
a feature is passed as well as important so returning back to the movie example right there could be an.
actor or a director right take maybe Christopher Nolan who directs very few movies right maybe one in few years.
right so if I look at all the data for the past 10 years we will have four to five.
of his movies right but this would be a very important deciding fact uh feature because his movies are generally.
good right so now if you completely ignore that feature if you are not bothered that hey this weights are.
