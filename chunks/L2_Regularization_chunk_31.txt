and now what we are seeing is that if the eigen values are small right then those weights are going.
to shrink a lot and that's exactly what we were hoping for and the other weights will remain the same.
as what they were earlier right they will not grow but they would remain the same as what they would.
have been in the absence of regularization right so now you are seeing the effect that certain weights are shrinking.
here and that's a proxy for controlling the model complexity because now you are not allowing the model to do.
what it wants you're not giving it you're given it capacity but then you have not given it the freedom.
to fully utilize this capacity the full capacity would be I should be able to take the weight W1 and.
set any value between minus infinity to Infinity 80 but now I am not allowing you to do that I.
have given you as many weights you wanted but on each weight I've now drawn some boundary and if you.
