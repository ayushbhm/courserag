said that what you're trying to do is take every stage you're doing this random movements and trying to make.
sure that the loss decreases but what you know is there's some true loss for for a surface which exists.
right so this is the loss surface right which exists and if I had directly plotted this loss function and.
how do I plot this logs function for all values of w comma B all possible values of w comma.
B and in this case I have only com considered values which are ranging from say minus 6 to plus.
six right for both W and B I just computed the loss I plugged it into the formula of loss.
and whatever I got I just kept plotting here and that way I got this entire surface right but this.
and now in this surface I can see that the loss is very high here if I choose the values.
of w and B to be um say minus Phi and Phi then it's very high if I choose it.
to be 4 and minus 4 close to 4 and minus 4 then the loss seems to be low right.
