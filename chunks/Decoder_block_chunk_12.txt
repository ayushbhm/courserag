to Z T one right now what will you do when you're Computing Z1 your formula was Alpha into v.
j j is equal to 1 to Capital T1 but now since you have decoded up till time step 3.
you will set you will let alpha 1 Alpha 2 Alpha 3 be whatever they were right and then you.
will set the remaining ones to zero right that's what you will do that's what masking does so the masking.
means that zeroing out the attention weights which do not matter right I'm just doing a slight uh abuse of.
explanation here in the sense that uh the alphas need to sum up to one right so while you mask.
out the zero you'll also do something so that these three now scale them up so that they become they.
sum up to one right but that is internal detail what you need to understand conceptually is that when you're.
Computing a refined representation of a Z1 you will set all the other Alphas to zero right similarly so this.
I should call as alpha 1 J so this is Alpha 1 1 Alpha 1 2 Alpha One three now.
