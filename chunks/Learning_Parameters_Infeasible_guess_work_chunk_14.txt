i concluded that i made the w negative maybe that's a problem right this is what my thinking was this.
is how i have come up with these numbers so let me interest increase the w so i increased the.
w and i made b a bit negative and the loss decreased okay so then i assumed okay increasing the.
w further and decreasing would be further might help and that actually helped and i kept continuing that way and.
it had right i'm doing random guesswork but it's slightly not so random because i'm looking at the loss values.
and slowly trying to adjust the weights right and all these values that i tried these are all the different.
functions that i got right so you can see what had happened for w equal to 0.50 you can go.
back and look at all these values so i was getting different uh functions and then as i kept changing.
it i somehow found the right function right so this is what my guesswork was and you can all imagine.
