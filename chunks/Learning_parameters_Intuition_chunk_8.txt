everything together in one collection i'm not saying that this is a matrix right this is just a collection of.
partial derivatives because each layer might have different so i just assume everything is n square here but we saw.
that other example where it could be n cross m here then m cross p here then some n here.
m here and then k here right for the biases right so it's all going to be different across different.
layers so this is not like a well-formed matrix it's just a collection i have put together just for illustrative.
purpose right so these are all the partial derivatives that i need to collect and i should be able to.
do this fairly uh conveniently and not like painfully go over every element and have to write down the formula.
for that and compute right i should be able to at least take one entire matrix of weights and compute.
the partial derivatives of all the elements at one goal right so that's what my quest is going to be.
