right let's look at the other case if x was a negative point and if i was making an error.
right so if w transpose x was greater than equal to 0 that means the current angle is less than.
90 degrees but what do i want i want it to be greater than 90 degrees right so if i.
look at it at one point one step at a time whatever is the current angle i want the new.
angle to be greater than this angle right so let's see if that happens if i do w nu equal.
to w minus x the same explanation cos alpha nu is going to be this i'll substitute the value i'll.
replace open up the bracket and now you can see that cos alpha nu is actually less than cos alpha.
right if cos alpha nu is less than cos alpha that means alpha nu is greater than alpha right and.
that's what i wanted my current angle was less than 90 degrees which was not acceptable to me i wanted.
it to be more than 90 degrees so this step has at least ensured that my angle and new angle.
