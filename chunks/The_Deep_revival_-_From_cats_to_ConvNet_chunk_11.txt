data sets that he experiment with is Ms so this data set was proposed in 1998 and this is what.
he had tested convolution neural networks on at that time right so the idea of cnns which became popular in.
image net in around 2012 was much earlier in existence it's just that it was not applied to very large.
scale problems like image net and then in 2012 when things were more conducive you had better optimization algorithms better.
initialization methods better activation functions better understanding of how to train deep neural networks it started showing success in those.
real world or other large-scale problems like image pilot had been in existence for quite a few years right.
