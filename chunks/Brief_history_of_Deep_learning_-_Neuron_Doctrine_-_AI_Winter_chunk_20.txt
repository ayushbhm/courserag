a sentence and you produce an output and what was being claimed is i can make a model which can.
take an english sentence and give you a russian sentence as output which would be very close to the true.
russian sentence that you would expect so those are the claims being made right any you could take a bunch.
of inputs and give the output which would be very close to the human output that you would expect now.
what uh minsky and pepper show that even for very simple functions right where this is not a very complex.
function but a very simple function like the xor function for two variables right just take one say a and.
b as input and you know what the xor function should give an output the perceptron is not capable of.
learning that also that means i cannot come up with a perceptron model which takes a and b as input.
and if i change a and b from 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 the output would be.
the same as the truth table of the xor function right so that's what they showed right and that kind.
