and then a bias right so now let's adjust a w1 and see what happens so if i increase w1.
right again as i keep you can see that as i keep increasing i'll do okay maybe i'll just use.
the yeah this is better so it's flat at zero and as i increase it starts becoming s right now.
the slope is very gentle right and as i keep increasing the value of w it becomes steep and steep.
till it becomes like a step function right so this w1 controls the uh movement in this direction right the.
slope in this direction okay now let's see what w2 does and for that i'll again make w one as.
zero okay and i'll start increasing w two you can see that w two is adjusting the slope in the.
other orientation right oh coordination so now what w 2 is doing is it's adjusting the slope in this direction.
right so as i keep increasing w 2 now oops as i keep increasing it it will become flatter and.
flatter in this direction right and now you can see b again just helps in movement along the direction right.
