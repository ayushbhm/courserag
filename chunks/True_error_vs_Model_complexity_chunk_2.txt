the expected value of this quantity and then this will not become zero hence the whole term will not become.
zero right so now when you are trying to estimate it from the training data this term is not disappearing.
right so now y minus f of x is not independent of F at x minus f of x because.
the training data was used for estimating the parameters so now these two quantities this expectation cannot be written as.
this product and hence it will not be zero and hence the empirical train error so now what is the.
empirical train uh if I had assumed if I had just done this approximation right so if you had asked.
me hey what is the error of your model and I said okay this is the error I have computed.
it from the training error I have estimated it empirically from the training data then actually you would have been.
way off why because this quantity is not zero so if this quantity is high then you are training your.
