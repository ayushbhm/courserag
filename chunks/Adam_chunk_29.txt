this weighted history right so at time step 40 I have 39 Blue Points below it and I'm going to.
take the value of each of those 39 blue points and I will say that beta raised to 39 into.
the value at time step or beta raised to 40 I guess right maybe 39 or 40 whatever that power.
comes to into the value at time step 0 right then beta raised to 38 into the value of time.
step T1 all the way up to 1 minus beta into the value at this t48 time step right so.
my new value is going to be uh this exponentially weighted average right that's what I'm going to do so.
let's see if I plot that so now for each of these Blue Points I could compute the new uh.
exponentially weighted uh value and then I can plot that right so let me see what happens if I plot.
that so this is what happens if I plot that without the bias correction right so what happens is that.
I get you can see that my black curve now is a bit farther away from the red curve at.
