T is equal to 4 so I'm asking whether Alpha 4 1 Alpha four two four three four four four.
five because I can take values from one to five can they be computed in parallel right and the answer.
is yes right because this only depends on St minus 1 which is already available and on hi which is.
already available right so it depends only on these two values so you can compute this this in parallel right.
and of course for normalization you need all the values but you can compute the scores in parallel and then.
once you have this course you can again compute the normalization in parallel right so for a given T you.
can compute the alpha tis in parallel for All Eyes no matter how many eyes you have right so no.
matter how long your sequence is you don't need to wait on the previous computation to happen or to have.
something happen at I minus 1 to be able to compute Alpha TI right you can just compute all of.
