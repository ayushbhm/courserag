consecutive contour lines is now very small right so then this is essentially a surface like this which is peaking.
at the two red portions and then it's going into a valley which is the Blue Valley and it's going.
steeply into the valley right that's why you see this steep slopes here where the difference between two consecutive contour.
lines is very small right so that's what the loss surface looks like now I ran gradient descent I started.
from some point I started all the three algorithms from the same point right and I started gradient descent ah.
momentum based gradient is a menstrual right and the as I would like to say let me just go back.
to the slides so there's something interesting that is these three algorithms are doing right and can you spot it.
is the question right so what exactly is happening here and remember that uh I should have mentioned that my.
horizontal axis is the W axis and my vertical axis is the B axis as has been appropriately labeled on.
