particular and but still they were not being used for real-world applications due to the other reasons which i had.
said right i mean compute was a challenge large scale data sets were a challenge but now when we enter.
2014 a lot of things fell into place right deep learning got better we had a better understanding of how.
to stabilize the training we had much more compute by this time gpus had already entered the scene we had.
much more data large-scale data sets which allowed training these networks right so and that's when in 2014 uh deep.
neural networks or recurrent neural network based models entered nlp and since then there's been almost no looking back right.
all these traditional models which were probabilistic and statistical in nature of course you also have some probabilistic modeling here.
but the statistical machine translation models which were popular at that time uh were almost completely replaced by these recurrent.
