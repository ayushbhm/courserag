just have to wait out that cycle and then again you might if you want a smaller learning rate it.
is going to come in sometime steps if you want a larger learning rate it's going to come into some.
time steps you just have to wait out that cycle right so that's that's the simple idea that you have.
here okay uh so now let's see whether this actually solves the problem that we started off right so we.
have this saddle point and we started with that initialization and looks like we will get stuck in the valley.
right so I have this exponentially decaying learning rate which is the black guy and that comes into the valley.
and gets stuck there but this blue guy has a chance because the exponentially decayed learning rate has become very.
small but now the blue guy because it can increase the learning rate at some point so even though the.
gradients there are small when the learning it just waits till the learning rate increases and then it gets per.
