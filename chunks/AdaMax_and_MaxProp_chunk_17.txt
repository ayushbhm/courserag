the pay point yeah so now when I'm using this L2 knob okay at time step 0 I get point.
zero zero one and then I use the bias corrected value and then my initial learning rate at time sorry.
my learning rate at time step uh 0 is going to be 1 okay that is same as what I.
had earlier now at time step 0 when I got the 0 input now you see that my learning rate.
is still changing right which should not have happened because I did not do anything at this time step so.
why should I change my learning rate but my learning rate is changing because of this exponentially moving uh L2.
Norm average that I'm taking right so now uh it increases the learning rate even though the gradient was zero.
and this is what the learning rate profile looks like it was one then at time step two for no.
reason my input was Zero still my learning rate became 1.4 right and then time step 3 it again decreased.
but again for a zero input it increased and so on right so it's more uh it it's still making.
