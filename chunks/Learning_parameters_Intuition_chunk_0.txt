[Music] okay so now let's talk about some intuition behind the intuition behind uh learning parameters for a feed forward.
neural network right and how do we connect it to what we already know right we have already seen how.
to learn parameters of a very simple network i mean it's not even a network but for a single neuron.
which had a w and a b and a single input and there was a y hat we had seen.
how to learn the parameters of this network using gradient descent now this thing that we know and understand well.
can we somehow stretch it and extend it to help us learn the parameters of all the parameters of a.
feed forward neural network right so that's what we'll try to focus on okay uh so the story so far.
is that we have introduced feed forward neural networks and now we are interested in finding an algorithm for learning.
the parameter right so this is what our feed forward neural network looks like now let's just quickly recall our.
