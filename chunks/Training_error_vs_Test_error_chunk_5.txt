the test data right so that's the connection between bias variance and the expected test error or the mean square.
error that you would have on the test data right or the Unseen data yeah so this is the situation.
that we have right the parameters of f hat X all the W's that we had they are estimated using.
the training data because that's all you have right but now why are we training the model because at test.
time you will get new images and you want to classify those images you want to say whether this image.
contains a bird or a parrot or does it contain a lion and so on right and that is what.
you want to do at test time you are going to work with unseen uh images right unseen meaning images.
which are not seen at training time right so now this gives us to the following two quantities right one.
is the training error right which is the error that you get on the training data so what does that.
