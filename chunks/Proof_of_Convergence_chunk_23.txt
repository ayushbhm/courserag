maximum number hence we have shown that k is a finite number so if the data is linearly separable right.
that means after a finite number of iterations the perceptron rolling algorithm will converge so although in our toy example.
it does not seem intuitive right that's easy to build this intuition that okay for one point i changed it.
for the second point again i changed it why were these updates not counterproductive so now we have a proof.
which says that the number of updates you will make will be finite if the data is linearly separable okay.
so that's what the perceptron uh this that's what the proof for the perceptron's learning algorithm say that it will.
converge okay so now coming back to our questions which we had started out so what about non-boolean inputs yes.
so real valued inputs are allowed in perceptron do we always need to hand code the threshold no now we.
can learn all the parameters not just the threshold w naught but also w1 to wn are all inputs equal.
