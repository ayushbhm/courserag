it i somehow found the right function right so this is what my guesswork was and you can all imagine.
that this guesswork could have possibly never ended these are very specific values and i chose them because i knew.
what the right value was and i was just trying to get that i mean i have reverse engineer these.
wasn't if i was completely randomly trying this this would not really converge that i would not end up anywhere.
right so now let us look at uh something better than this guesswork algorithm right so this is slightly better.
than the guesswork algorithm so what i have done here is again i had seen we had seen this earlier.
so i've just plotted so my this is my uh oops this is my w axis this is my b.
axis okay and the vertical axis is the error axis right so for all possible values of w and b.
i have just computed the loss i can do that i can do that programmatically and i have just plotted.
