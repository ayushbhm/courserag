well on the test data because that is unknown data so you have focused so much on uh they fixated.
so much on what was given to you that you are now not going to be able to generalize on.
some unknown data right and we will see all of this in detail in this lecture and that's where the.
concept of bias and variance comes in and its relation to the capacity of the model and what I'm trying.
to say on this slide and which you all know is that deep learning models have a very high capacity.
because they have a large number of parameters okay so that was the context and with that context I'll start.
the discussion on bias and variance so let's look at this right so we look at an example where uh.
we want to fit a curve right so what do I mean by that right so I have been given.
some data points the data points have actually come from the sinusoidal function that means I know what the true.
f of x is in this case right so I have X and my true relation between X and Y.
