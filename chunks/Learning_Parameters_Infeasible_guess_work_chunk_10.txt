and just on the previous slide we saw that when the network is trained or when i have learned the.
values of wnb i would expect these points to lie on the sigmoid function but right now it's clearly not.
the case so this is bad there is no argument about that but how bad is it can you quantify.
that all of you are saying that it's bad right that's a qualitative answer can you quantify that yeah right.
so the answer given is that we could look at the loss function right so we now what we will.
do is that we look at the loss function which depends on w and b and we'll see how to.
calculate the loss function and then we'll be able to say exactly how bad this is right so let's do.
that right so my values of w and b i know are 3 and minus 1. so i know that.
this is equal to 1 over 1 plus e raised to minus of 3x plus b and b i have.
chosen s minus 1 so this is what my function looks like now in this function i'll plug in all.
