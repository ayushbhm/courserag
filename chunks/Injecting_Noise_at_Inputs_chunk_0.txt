foreign [Music] technique that we're going to see is about adding noise to the inputs so earlier I used to.
have a different sequence in the course where I used to First teach Auto encoders and then do that but.
do this lecture but now I've changed that so I'll just make some changes on this slide accordingly so we.
will see this in the auto encoder but for now let's assume you have the following setup that you are.
given a certain input and you have say a one layer Network just ignore this for now right I'll come.
back to this soon so this is your inputs assume this layer is not there this layer is directly feeding.
into this and then you have the output right so this is what your normal neural network would look like.
now what weight uh adding weight uh noise to the weights what this method does is you take your inputs.
let's assume your inputs were say binary for the sake of simplicity right now what you do is you add.
