that I can mine from here right and I would May is base my decision on several factors so say.
salinity could be one right then I could look at the density of the water there right sorry this pen.
is not really working well but I'll just go ahead so salinity density you understand what I'm saying then maybe.
I can look at the pressure at that location I could look at the temperature at that location I could.
look at the Marine diversity at that location right so all of these are real values so it's all of.
these belong to R all of these are real values and I might base my decision on N such different.
factors right and this we have been discussing for a while that whenever I take decision I consider a lot.
of inputs and now I'm talking about n inputs each of them is a real number so this Vector that.
I am looking at here is a vector which belongs to RM right so that's the idea now so that's.
what I meant by this that X belongs to RN and now what is it that I'm trying to predict.
