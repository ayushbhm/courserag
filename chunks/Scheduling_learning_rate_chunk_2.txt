Learning rate would still have been a large quantity and I would still have got the effect of moving faster.
right and it does make sense that learning rate is how fast you move so maybe that would have helped.
so now let's see what happens if we had gone by this intuition and set the learning rate to 10.
instead of 1 right and it's like 10 times what I had set it otherwise right so let's see what.
happens in that case so my learning rate is set to 10 now of course it's moving fast but then.
again you see the problem of oscillation right so it kind of uh on this you want it to be.
fast on the gentle places but you don't want it to be fast once it enters the value right because.
on the Steep surfaces anyways the gradient is large so it's going to move fast but now we have multiplied.
it by the large learning rate and hence you see that there's this oscillation effect right so we don't really.
