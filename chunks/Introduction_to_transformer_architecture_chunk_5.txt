and just see the whole thing right so I had the entire sentence I am still Computing it one step.
at a time and I'll compute it at Z H1 then H2 then I am Computing H3 then H4 and.
so on right so I'm just doing all of this one step at a time although this entire sentence was.
available to me right at the beginning right so now the question is what's the benefit of what is happening.
here right so why am I Computing H2 only after I have looked at H1 right so the reason for.
that is that I know that for every word I already have the word embedding right so that's what my.
input is and this word embedding could be computed from your favorite algorithm like what to make or fast X.
or glove embedding or it could just be randomly initialized it could just be a learnable parameter in the network.
right but that is the word that is the embedding of the word computed from a corpus but I want.
to know the embedding of this word in the context of the center so that's what these Yellow Boxes are.
