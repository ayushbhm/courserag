what that curve looks like so every time you can see I am getting a different curve right you can.
see all the different curves that I am getting here okay I am done now right so you understood the.
procedure now let's try to make some observations from these plots so simple methods trained on different samples of the.
data do not differ from each other right so I had a total of 500 training points given to me.
and I took different random samples of 400 multiple times I took a different sample of 400 and each of.
these lines corresponds to one of those sample training data sets and I found the values of w and W.
naught and plotted this and you can see that all these lines are very close to each other right they.
are not really giving me different solutions right but the same thing when I do with the complex function you.
can see that all of these are quite different right so you have something which is going like this you.
