should again look at it i'm pointing you to it again and again because that's important right now notice something.
about this formula right so that this y c right now y c can be y 1 y 2 y.
3 all the way up to y k but it will take on the value 1 only for the correct.
class right only when c is equal to l that means only for the true cross label in this case.
only y one is going to be one and all the other y's are going to be zero right that.
means when you're taking this summation and you have y one multiplied by something y two multiplied by something y.
three multiplied by something and so on then only one of these terms is going to survive right the term.
which had a value 1 and all the terms which had value 0 are going to disappear in the summation.
so although i've written this as a summation it will only have one term which would be y l multiplied.
by log of y hat l and that y hat yl is again going to be just one right so.
