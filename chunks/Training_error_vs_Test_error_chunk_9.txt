the two sinusoidal function and on the right hand side you have the high variance models which give a low.
error on the training data but still give you a high error on the test data right and you're looking.
for this Sweet Spot somewhere in the middle where you have a good trade-off and you have the ideal model.
complexity right so now let us formally ah Define the train error and the test error right so let there.
be n training points and M test points right so these are the N training points that were given to.
you then you can Define the training error as this right which is known to you so over all the.
end points I'm going to take the average mean square error right so average square error or the mean square.
error that's what I'm going to do and this is for the N training points and then for the m.
test points which is n plus 1 to n plus 1 M points I can similarly Define the test error.
