to be as close to 1 because we know that for the true class the probability is 1. okay so.
this is what we have done so far we have looked at two types of problems one problem where the.
output values are real values these are the regression problems and the other values where the outputs are probabilities these.
are the classification problems are two popular family of problems we have looked at for the regression problems we said.
that the output function should just be linear because we don't want the output to be bounded between anything and.
whatever is the natural range of the output the loss function will make sure that the network predicts something in.
that range itself because otherwise the loss will become very large right for the classification problems the output function was.
the soft max function and then the loss function for the regression problems for squared error and for the classification.
