i'm just telling you which is obvious that this quantity is nothing but the dot product between the weight vector.
and the data vector right the data point that i have so we can just rewrite the perceptron rule as.
the following so y is equal to 1 if the dot product is greater than equal to zero and y.
is equal to zero if the dot product is less than zero nothing magical here the dot product is just.
equal to this so i have replaced that cumbersome notation of summation and w i x i by this more.
compact dot product right now this is where now we need to start digging on if you're looking at the.
dot product right so now i've gotten hold of some quantity that i can try to explore from a linear.
algebra perspective right what does a dot product mean and then try to come up with some explanation for why.
should the algorithm work or what does it make why is it making sense right so we are interested in.
