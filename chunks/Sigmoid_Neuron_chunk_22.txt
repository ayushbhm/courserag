to do that you have to predict a certain binary value and you would like to predict it as a.
probability that this not harsh zero and one but this is a 49 chance of finding oil there there's a.
49 chance that this person will not return the rule and then as a domain expert you can decide whether.
you want to invest in that or not right okay okay so that's that's what it is and this is.
how the two functions look like very similar right the inputs are actually similar as you can see the weights.
are also available you have an output you know that these are all real values you know that the output.
is real value right in fact in the perceptron also you could have had real values it's just that we.
were only looking at Boolean but the main difference is in this function here right you have the sigmoid function.
here and you have the step function there and that step function is obvious because of the formula that we.
