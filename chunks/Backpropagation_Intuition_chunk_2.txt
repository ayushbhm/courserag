intuition for how what would that formula look like and then do some hard work but then come back to.
a state where we can then say okay once i know how to compute this this red guy can i.
compute all the weights in that network in one go right can i compute the derivatives uh the partial derivatives.
for the loss function with respect to all the weights in that layer once i know how to do it.
for one weight in that layer right then that would not not require us to compute these many formulae but.
just one formula and then we could generalize it and also not just that once i know it for one.
layer can i do apply a similar formula for all the layers right then we are coming up with a.
very generalized formula and the computations will become easier but that's for later for now i want to understand how.
to compute this right so we'll see how to calculate that but first let us look at a very simple.
