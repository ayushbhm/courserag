in adagrad uh this VT was uh sorry this should have been Square so this Delta WT Square should have.
been there and I when I had shown you the plots I had shown that VT never decreases right it.
keeps increasing and then it saturates but does not decrease even though the derivative has become zero VT keeps increasing.
and then it saturates right so it does not ever decrease to it does not start falling down right uh.
now what happens in the case of RMS prompt right so let's see what is happening in the case of.
RMS prop so you have this uh let me just annotate so this is your derivative so derivative increased increase.
in the negative Direction and then it started decreasing and then it became zero and then you are seeing this.
oscillations right so that let's not go into the oscillations but the main point here is that if you look.
at your VT it is increasing and then it starts decreasing also right so e v t can decrease in.
