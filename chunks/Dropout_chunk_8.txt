so we initialize all the weights of the network so there are in this network this is my base Network.
right I'm not creating multiple copies of this this is my only Network so whatever weights are there so let's.
assume there are n parameters everywhere uh sorry n nodes everywhere so you have have a n cross n weight.
sitting here you have an N cross n weight Matrix sitting here I'm ignoring the biases for the while and.
suppose you have only one output neuron then you are n weights sitting here right so these all these uh.
2N squared plus n weights I have initialized okay and I have started training now I received the first mini.
batch for training and I just drop some notes from the network right so I've got a thinned version of.
the network for the first mini batch right and now I'm just going to assume that this is what my.
neural network looks like and just do my forward propagation and backward propagation right so I'll compute the loss using.
