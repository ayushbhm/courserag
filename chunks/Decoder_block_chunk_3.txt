would also be a multi-layered network so it would have say typically 6 to 12 8 any I mean depending.
on the kind of uh training data you have the amount of training data you have the kind of problem.
that you're dealing with you would have any number of layers but the most basic ones have six eight or.
twelve layers right so there are 12 layers of processing happening and just as in the case of encoder each.
of these layers has an identical structure right so whatever is happening within a layer is the same is just.
that the output of one layer acts as the input to the next layer right so that's the same as.
what we had in the encoder but now what we need to look at is what is inside each of.
these layers right that's what we need to understand so let's zoom into one such layer so you will have.
the inputs so these are the uh small H number of time steps which have been decoded so far right.
