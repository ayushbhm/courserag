if we can somehow solve that problem okay so now let's examine this a bit more uh closely yeah so.
you remember that we are accumulating this history now V 0 is Delta W 0 squared V1 is Delta W.
0 squared plus Delta W1 square and so on right so this is constantly growing VT is constantly growing uninhibitedly.
because you are adding those uh derivatives right and uh our derivative is proportional to X that means for the.
uh feature which is pass these derivatives would be small so then our history will accumulate slowly hence this effective.
learning rate will Decay slowly and it's also possible that initially it increases because us denominator might be less than.
one so the effective learning rate increases and even when it decreases it is slow to decrease right because your.
accumulations may happen only after a large number of iterations such that the denominator becomes large and then the effect.
