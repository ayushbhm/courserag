foreign [Music] ing so the main question is right what has changed now right what has happened in 2006 which.
has allowed us to train these deep neural networks and why has big deep learning become so popular that's the.
main question so far right uh so if we look at this seminal work in 2006 which made uh training.
deep neural networks are more uh possible Right so the original paper I was actually talks about something known as.
rbms we have not done ibms yet and we'll not do it in this part of the course uh I.
will try to explain it in the context of Auto encoders again we have not done Auto encoders now I've.
also Auto encoders will also not be a part of this course because we have replaced it by other more.
advanced optimization algorithms as well as discussion on Transformers so we did not have place to put in autoencoders given.
the number of lectures that we had so but you could refer to my older lectures and auto encoders if.
