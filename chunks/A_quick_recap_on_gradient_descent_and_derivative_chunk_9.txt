of w and B to be um say minus Phi and Phi then it's very high if I choose it.
to be 4 and minus 4 close to 4 and minus 4 then the loss seems to be low right.
I can do all this but this is not again feasible right so I just had two parameters and I.
just uh did this cheating of restricting the weights between minus six to six but actually the values are wnb.
can take our minus infinity to infinity and if you have like a large number of parameters that we had.
in that complex neural network then you can't really draw this plot that means Brute Force compute all the values.
for the loss and find that value which is the smallest and then go and find the W and B.
which will corresponding so you can't do this right so this guesswork or just Computing a Brute Force both are.
infeasible the guesswork can lead you to uh false Direction so when I was guessed trying to guess the values.
are W and B at some points I was making a guess such that my loss was actually more than.
