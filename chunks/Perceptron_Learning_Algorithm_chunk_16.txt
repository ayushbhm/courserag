to the weight vector and that's what is happening if i had a positive point on which i was making.
an error then i was changing the weight vector by adding the point to it right so let's see what.
happens by that right so if x is belonging to p and if w transpose x is less than 0.
that's what this expression means right then it means that the angle between this x and the current w is.
greater than 90 degrees right but that is not what i wanted i wanted this angle to be less than.
90 degrees so now what is it what should my goal be if i am in this situation that my.
w and x are such that the angle is greater than 90 degrees and i want it to be less.
than 90 degrees so i should try to adjust the w at least such that whatever is the current angle.
that angle should decrease it may not become less than 90 degrees at one shot but at least it should.
decrease from where it is currently because right now i am in a bad situation and that's what i should.
