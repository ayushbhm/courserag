as the first one was of the form Y is equal to MX plus C right and here you have.
a quadratic term so this is nothing but Y is equal to ax Square plus BX plus C right so.
now I'm approximating the function as a quadratic function right and these coefficients are coming from the derivatives as was.
the case in the first case the first first order derivative the second order derivative right so what does that.
mean it means that now I'm approximating the red curve by this uh c n or blue colored curve right.
and you can see that in the small neighborhood now right this neighborhood now the second order approximation is actually.
better than the first other approximation right it's more closer the blue curve in that small neighborhood is more closer.
to the red curve than the black curve is to the red curve right so this is you can just.
keep cutting the formula wherever you want and that's what the approximation gives how this relates to what we are.
