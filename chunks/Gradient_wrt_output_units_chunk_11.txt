the gradient with respect to the entire vector but we didn't go there directly we first computed the partial derivative.
with respect to one of the elements and then once we had that we were able to write down the.
formula for the entire vector right uh so this same recipe is going to repeat everywhere we are going to.
first try to if you have any interest in a derivative of some quantity with respect to vector we'll first.
try to find out the partial derivative with respect to one element of that vector right and then generalize for.
the entire vector okay that's what we are going to do so now with that let me just try to.
find the derivative of the loss function with respect to a l and what i am going to do is.
first try to find the derivative with respect to one of the elements which is the ith element so again.
a l is actually a l 1 a l 2 all the way up to a l k right so.
from with respect to any generic element of that vector i am trying to find the derivative of the loss.
