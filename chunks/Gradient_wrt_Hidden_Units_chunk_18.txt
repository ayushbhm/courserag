and wherever I see a j I am going to substitute 1 2 3 all the way up to n.
right so this is what it's going to look like it's a DOT product between the First Column of the.
weight Matrix with the gradient Vector the dot product of the second column of the weight Matrix with respect to.
the gradient Vector the dot product of the last column of the weight Matrix with respect to the with the.
gradient Vector right so what is that looking like this is the so let me just try to write the.
Matrix W transpose right w i plus 1 transpose so this would be the first column of w i plus.
1 this would be the second column of w i plus 1 all the way up to the nth column.
of w i plus one remember I am writing the transpose hence I am drawing rows but saying Columns of.
w i plus 1 and all of this is getting multiplied by this gradient Vector right this gradient so essentially.
what I'm doing is that every uh uh every uh element of this Vector is essentially the product of one.
