atom look like and here this is looking at the L2 Norm what we mean by that is that if.
you have or rather exponentially weighted average L2 numerate so you have uh V 0 it is simply Delta W.
0 square right because initially you don't have any other term or rather 1 minus into one minus beta right.
and then if you look at VT it will have Delta W 0 square appropriately multiplied by some Decay Factor.
then Delta W 1 square again multiplied by some Decay factor and all the way up to the current gradient.
right multiplied by 1 minus beta right so if I just ignore the Decay factors and if I treat this.
as a collection of values as a vector then what I'm looking at is the L2 Norm of that Vector.
right so that's what I uh what is the meaning here and it's just not an L2 Norm it's an.
exponentially weighted L2 Norm that you are taking right so that's what you need to remember if you look at.
VT it has all the terms from Delta W 0 square all the way up to Delta w t square.
