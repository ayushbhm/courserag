my loss is non-zero so who is responsible for this so this loss was sitting here so i will ask.
these guys first these are the dark green guys that i'll ask first right i'll ask them sorry hey you.
are not producing the desired output right because if you guys were perfect then my loss would have been zero.
so why are you not producing the desired output you should take responsibility you should do give me better output.
but these dark the shaded green guys and they'll say hey what can i do right i what responsibility can.
i take but i am only as good as the hidden layer before me right because how did i get.
the dark green guys these are the dark green guys how did i get them i had certain values in.
the previous layer i multiplied them by the weights and the biases and then i get so this y hat.
will tell me i can't do anything right whatever these guys gave me i just computed soft max on that.
