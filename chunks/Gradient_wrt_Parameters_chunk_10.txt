the same situation that you have uh here right if you compare all these guys were the same again all.
of these are b1s all these guys are the same all of these are V2s all these guys are the.
same all of these are p3s right and similarly all these three guys are the same just as these three.
guys were the same and so on right so what I'm trying to say is that this Matrix here can.
actually be written as the outer product of two vectors and what are those two vectors this is one vector.
right so this will be your B vector and uh this will form your a vector right so that's how.
I'm going to write it now the outer product between these two vectors so this is what it's going to.
look like this is the a vector and this is the B Vector the transpose operated because that was the.
sleeping vector and the a vector was the standing Vector right so now you have a formula for the derivative.
of the loss function with respect to K and what do you need for that you need two quantities one.
