coming out has significantly increased not such just research right there's also a lot of startups and interest in big.
tech companies uh in the area of ai and this has resulted in exponential growth in terms of the number.
of patents that are getting filed in ai right so this i call this a period of absolute madness where.
ai has kind of taken over everyone's imagination and now it is the field that you want to work in.
it is the field that you want to start have a startup in or have a phd in and so.
on right so they're living in that uh era which is very different from the ai winter which i had.
said right it's quite on the opposite side now a lot of funding for research in ai a lot of.
funding for startups in ai and so on right so just kind of uh recapping or seeing the same period.
from a different lens of how the research and development output has increased in ai in the past few years.
