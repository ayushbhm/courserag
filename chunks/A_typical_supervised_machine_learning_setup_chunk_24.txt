objective right so that the objective is to minimize the error function and that's what the objective is now how.
do you come up with the learning algorithm how do you define the objective function right so up till this.
point i have defined everything mathematically right but now objective function have objective function i have not defined so i.
will have to tell you what the objective function is but we will come back to that okay so now.
consider our movie example so this is the movie data given to me right x i is equal to movie.
i'm just using a shortcut when i say x is equal to movie i i mean that entire vector right.
all the actor information budget information number of superstars blah blah and y i is equal to 0 comma 1.
right so that's what it is our approximation of the relation between x and y so our approximation was that.
y hat is equal to the sigmoid function of x right with the parameters being w okay then learning algorithm.
