minus infinity to infinity right so there are infinite possibilities here of those i want one such w which if.
i plug in if i were able to plug in all these infinite values of w into this equation right.
this is the equation that i care about and i want that w which will give me the smallest value.
for the loss function that's what my goal is right so that's the objective of training now the other thing.
that i want to say here right i just want to talk a bit more about this learning algorithm and.
the loss function right so any kind of learning as i said is always driven by some objective right and.
i like to give this analogy let's suppose in high school you're learning trigonometry right so when you're learning the.
chapter what are you doing you're reading the chapter because you're allowed to read this is not a test right.
you're allowed to read the textbook and your goal would be to ensure that all the formulae which are given.
