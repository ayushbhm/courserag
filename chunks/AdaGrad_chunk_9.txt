lot in the direction of B right and that is expected because B was the dense feature hence its gradients.
were larger and hence you were making larger movements in the direction of B whereas W was the sparse feature.
intentionally made sparse as explained on the previous slide so the gradients for w are smaller and hence you are.
making smaller movements in the direction of w right and after you reach the valley then the algorithms realize that.
now there is no more uh value in moving in the direction of B right anyways the gradients that are.
becoming smaller now because you have reached the Steep region and then it slowly starts moving very very slow steps.
in the direction of w because there again the gradients are small what can you do but then it still.
moves in that direction and then it reaches the minimum all right so it takes a right angled path right.
whereas ideally you would have wanted something which just directly travels like this which would mean that it is making.
