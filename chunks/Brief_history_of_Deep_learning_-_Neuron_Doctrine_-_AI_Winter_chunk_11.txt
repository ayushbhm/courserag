right so around 1943 while we were still trying to understand uh what uh the brain is and we are.
in fact i mean still today trying to understand it uh uh mcculloch and pits right to neuroscientists and logistics.
right and again people coming from different fields who were contributing to this area right of course at that time.
computer science was not so evolved it was still a field which was in formation right so uh or just.
getting formed so so these two uh uh one neuroscientist and logician they proposed a simplified model of the neuron.
and this is something that we'll do in the course in uh detail in the next lecture itself where they.
just said that a neuron a model of the brain would be that there are multiple inputs coming to it.
right and these could be inputs from a sensory organs and based on that it takes a decision and a.
