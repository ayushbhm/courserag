image net and similar challenges and started showing uh again it's not just gain but starting winning some of these.
uh prestigious competitions right so that's where we are and then after that from 2016 onwards there was further acceleration.
right so we wanted to come with better optimization methods so now we know that it's possible to train deep.
neural networks but now can we do it faster can we lead to convergence faster right what this animation here.
is trying to show that i want to come to this configuration where the two points on the left-hand side.
figure exactly fit or the sigmoid function exactly fits to those two points and i'm trying to solve some optimization.
problem for that and it's taking me a while to reach to the solution right so can i speed that.
up right of course faster convergence was always a goal all right which existed in machine learning when we had.
