you did not have the alpha term now since you have the alpha term this term gets added right so.
L2 regularization is very easy to implement if you have already implemented gradient descent then all you need to do.
is change this update Rule and add this term or subtract this term and you have the L2 regularized update.
rule for green interesting right now this becomes more complicated as you look at other algorithms like atom and variance.
of it and so on but we will not discuss those but at least in the case of vanilla gradient.
descent where the update rule was just move in the direction opposite to the gradient it's now subtract that term.
and then further subtract this term that's all your update rule is so extremely easy to implement now let us.
see what is the geometric interpretation of this right so to understand the geometric interpretation we will do slightly uh.
long ish I would say a derivation right we'll just try to uh go a bit deeper uh into what.
