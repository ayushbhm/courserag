right but that is the word that is the embedding of the word computed from a corpus but I want.
to know the embedding of this word in the context of the center so that's what these Yellow Boxes are.
allowing me to compute because they are taking input from the rest of the sentence right now you might ask.
hey I'm only taking input from one side right I am not really considering Transformers when I am Computing the.
yellow box for uh movie right but there are also known as something known as bi-directional rnns or bidirectional lstms.
where you start from right to left right so this is how the computation proceeds for all practical purposes you.
could think of I have one sentence I enjoyed the movie Transformers so I computed these Yellow Boxes the way.
RNN does it then I reverse the sentence so I feed in Transformers movie is the Android I and I.
again do the computation and then again compute some other say green boxes right and now I have two representations.
