not possible to do for all the possible X's I need to compute the Y hats also know the true.
y but if I already knew the true y for all possible X's then there's nothing to estimate right so.
I just have a small sample of reasonable size so I'm just going to empirically estimate the expectation using that.
sample right so wherever I see expected value of y hat minus y the whole Square I am going to.
replace it by this formula okay so that is the main idea and that's why on the previous slide I.
was saying that this is something that we can compute and now I have shown you how to compute that.
right so let us return back ah to our derivation now so this is the expectation this is the expected.
error right the true error that we were interested in Computing I call this a true error because this is.
the difference between the predicted value and the true function value right but we do not know the true function.
