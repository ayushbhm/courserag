loan that that person had taken how many years that those loan was repaid in what was the interest rate.
for that loan was there any defaults and all of these you can see are real numbers and then the.
output is also a real number which you want to decide an interest rate maybe something between say five to.
twenty percent right that's what you want to decide so this is another problem right so these are the kind.
of problems that we are interested in dealing with where your inputs are real numbers and your outputs are also.
real numbers right and we'll take this idea further where we'll start later on in the course talking about images.
right and even if you look at images what is an image if you look at a 100 cross 100.
image these are pixel values which tell you some colors right so these are all again real numbers and based.
on these real numbers which is a very high dimensional Vector because you're looking at a hundred cross hundred Vector.
