but actually it hasn't because i have added this i equal to 0 right so what i am saying now.
is that my sum earlier was w 1 x 1 plus w 2 x 2 plus blah blah blah up.
to minus theta greater than equal to 0 right that's what this equation was saying now i am starting from.
w naught right because it's i equal to 0 so i have w naught x naught plus all of this.
and then the theta is disappeared there is no theta in this equation so what have i done actually all.
i am saying is that i am going to have an imaginary input x naught which is equal to 1.
and then another weight w naught which is actually equal to minus theta so if i substitute these values then.
these two inequalities become the same right if i make w naught as minus theta and x naught as 1.
and i just get minus theta as the first term of this sum of terms and then uh that these.
two inequalities that i have here right so as i said this was same and then greater than equal to.
