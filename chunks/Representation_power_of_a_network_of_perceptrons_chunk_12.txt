to zero there only the w2 into h2 term will remain which will just be w2 because h2 is one.
that okay now for the next input w3 the next input w4 right now if i go back to my.
conditions what are the conditions that i want so if i want this to behave like the xor function then.
w one should be less than w naught right in that case it will not fire and hence it will.
be the same as the truth table of the xor function let me just clear some things so w 1.
should be less than w naught if that is the case then it will not fire and i will get.
the output the desired output is that ok so this is minus 1 right uh ah okay okay oh this.
is the truth table yeah the two table has a problem so this should have been 0 1 and this.
should have been 1 0 okay is always fine now ok so now for this to behave so this is.
the aggregated that i get right now what is my y if the aggregation is less than w naught then.
it will be 0 if it is greater than w naught it will be 1 right so now for this.
