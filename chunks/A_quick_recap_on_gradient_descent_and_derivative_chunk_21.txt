trying to now and get a reasoning for this right why is this happening so what exactly is happening there.
right so what is our movement right what do I mean by the movement so let me just make that.
clear first right so my update rule is W is equal to W minus ETA into Delta W okay so.
now if my this quantity is very small let's say it's 0 right then my new W would be the.
same as the old W right I'll not be moving right hence when I was looking at this uh WB.
plane at the bottom right now I'm trying to update the values of w as well as uh B now.
these updates are very small right then what will happen is I was at some WB and I'll now again.
remain very close to that right and not move very far but if these updates are large then my w.
will change by a large value so say w was uh here it will change by a large value and.
go somewhere here and my B will also change by a large value and go somewhere else so hence now.
