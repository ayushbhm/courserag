how much does this change right so there are six values that you're trying to compute so then set what.
we are three cross two or two cross three depending on how your uh uh seeing it right so it.
could uh so it that's what it would be right so that's what and this second order derivative is called.
the Hessian uh uh Matrix and then similarly you could imagine what would be here there would be a third.
order uh derivative here and you can again imagine that you have a matrix and now you're taking the derivative.
of every element in that Matrix with respect to a vector and so on it but that that I know.
I won't go that far I'll just stop here although even this we don't need for the current lecture okay.
so I hope that is clear so uh partial derivatives derivatives sorry derivatives partial derivatives collection of partial derivatives is.
the gradient the gradient of the gradient is the Hessian right and here are a few things to note now.
