here so feed forward neural network is only acting as a projection layer here right so uh so this is.
the input S1 okay there's some intermediate being computed let me just call it uh say m okay right and.
then you get Z1 at the output right so this could again be five and two dimensional input one zero.
two four dimensional projection and then again five into dimensional output and of course there would be a non-linearity here.
you could use any non-linearity that you want right and typically it is one of the relu based either gelu.
or one of those normal non-linearities okay and the same set of parameters right so this here would have some.
parameters right so you'll have some W's here and then some another set of W's here right so let me.
just call them W Feed forward Network and let me call this W1 because it's layer 1 and W2 Layer.
Two right so the same set of parameters will be used everywhere right so each of these s1s or sis.
