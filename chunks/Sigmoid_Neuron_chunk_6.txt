on these real numbers which is a very high dimensional Vector because you're looking at a hundred cross hundred Vector.
now and I can just flatten it out and I'll have 10 000 values which correspond to the pixel values.
right so let's assume it's only a gray and white images right so you will have certain pixel values there.
and this is uh uh 100 dimensional vector and based on this you might want to predict a certain y.
right so this is again of all of these are cases where your inputs are real and your outputs are.
also here and you have a high dimensional input where I'm just calling it as RN which is an N.
dimensional Vector right so this is the situation that we want to uh deal with now given this situation or.
given these kinds of problems what is our Quest right our Quest would be just as it is on the.
case of perceptrons when we are dealing with or in the last lecture when we are dealing with Boolean functions.
