is excited enough if this is really something very comical then it might uh get activated and in turn signal.
to the other neurons that hey we need to do something to evoke loft right so that's a very cartoonish.
illustration and i said in reality it's not just like a single neuron but it's like a network of neurons.
that you have and these neurons are arranged in layers so that initial set of neurons at the lowest level.
which interact with the sensory organs and then they get some input and then based on that input some of.
them might get excited and pass activate other neurons in other layers and this might continue till finally a response.
is a physical response is evoked and and in this case that response could be laughter right so the main.
takeaway here is that there's like this massive network of interconnected neurons which are interacting with each other arranged in.
