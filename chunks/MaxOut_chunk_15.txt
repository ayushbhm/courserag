of you are being responsible for the output and the certain nodes may not maybe get spatialized for the specific.
input right so that's what is happening in the case of Dropout now if you look at the sub model.
that we have in the case of max out what is happening here is the following right so this is.
what is happening in max out now I have considered a max out layer and because I can't show many.
uh neurons here this is One max out neuron okay this max out neuron in turn has three nodes each.
of this has some uh linear transformation right so this is W1 transpose X this is W2 transpose X this.
is W3 transpose X and then I'm only taking the max of these guys and allowing it to pass forward.
right so in essence these two nodes have been dropped out because of the max operation so you are getting.
the same effect as Dropout similarly you have these two nodes here three this max out neuron here which has.
