derivative of the loss function with respect to the ith shaded green guy right but we are all we are.
not interested in one partial derivative we are interested in the entire collection of partial derivatives so i want to.
talk about the gradient with respect to the vector y hat not just the partial derivative with respect to one.
of the elements of the screen right so what do i mean by that so this is i'm going to.
write the gradient of the loss function with respect to y hat right so this is what my notation is.
and what does this mean right this is what it means it's just a collection of the partial derivatives of.
the loss function with respect to all the elements of y hat and what are all the elements of y.
hat y 1 hat y 2 hat all the way up to y k hat right so it's just a.
collection of all these guys and i have the formula for any one of them right so this is what.
the formula looks like the formula was indicator variable l equal to i divided by y hat l and the.
