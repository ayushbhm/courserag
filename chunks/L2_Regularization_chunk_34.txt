interpretation also of this so now what I'm showing you here are two loss Contours so and we are using.
the same uh oops so this is my uh LW so this is what my unregularized loss looks like this.
is my Alpha W transpose sorry not Alpha Dot this is what my w transpose W looks like so this.
is the regularization loss and you can see that that loss has this uh if you look at this this.
Contour here this is the Contour of a bowel which is the Contour of a square function and indeed it.
should be the Contour of a square function because this is a square function right so this is the place.
where W transfer transpose W is equal to say one W transpose W equal to two three and so on.
right so these are the Contours that you have here and these are the Contours of w right now let's.
make some observation about these plots right and what is w tilde W tilde is the place where these two.
plots are intersecting right of course the I could have drawn some more uh this Contours will go on right.
