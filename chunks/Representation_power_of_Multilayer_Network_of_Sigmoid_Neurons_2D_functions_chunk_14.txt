move it around yeah in this in this region again both are 0 so if you're going to add them.
you'll again get 0 and then let me just move all the way back again in this region both are.
0 so if you add them up you'll get 0. so you have understood what is happening at the flat.
surface is it you can just again go back and play around with this you can just move it around.
and you can see it right now let's look at the other regions right so where there's not going to.
be zero output if you look at this region okay so then you can see that the let me just.
orient it properly okay i'll just delete all my marks oops okay i'm really having trouble in adjusting to this.
okay um yeah this is a good view so now if i look in this region right so this purple.
guy was 1 but the cn guy was 0. so if i add 1 plus 0 i'll again get 1.
here right same argument for this region where the cn guy was 1 but the purple guy is 0 so.
