over the years okay so with that uh primer let me just start so as i was trying to say.
that when we talk about deep learning uh we're talking about neural networks and at least we hear that keep.
hearing that a lot of inspiration comes from the biological neurons or at least we are also currently uh still.
striving right to try to understand how the brain does things and maybe come up with models of that right.
so let's start that history uh from biology actually and we go back uh quite a bit of quite a.

to understand what does our nervous system look like right and joseph von gerlach who was one of the researchers.
