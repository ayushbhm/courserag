is the training error right which is the error that you get on the training data so what does that.
mean uh I think we'll Define that quantity formally soon and the other is the test error which is the.
error that you get on the test data right and you would ideally want both to be zero you want.
the training error to also be zero that means once I have trained the model at least for the training.
data it should be able to predict everything perfectly right give me close to zero and then of course on.
the test data also I want it to be 0 right so typically what happens is these errors exhibit the.
following behavior that if you have a high model complexity right and in our case we saw this degree 25.
polynomial if you had increased it further it would have almost perfectly fit the training data that means my training.
error would have gone 0 as my model complexity increased right but what would happen is the test error would.
