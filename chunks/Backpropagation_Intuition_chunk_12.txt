do i am a function of the previous guys so maybe you should go and talk to them right and.
then of course you cannot pass the responsibility to the input input is whatever it is right you cannot say.
oh change your input if you want the right output right no i have given you a certain input i.
expect you to uh give me the output so the responsibility never goes to the input but what you realize.
is that in the entire network the responsibility lies with all the weights all the yellow things that i have.
shown here right all the weights and all the biases these guys although they are being computed they are just.
a function of the weights and the biases so their weights and biases are wrong then these guys are going.
to be wrong right and this argument flows all through the network and then you find out that the responsibility.
lies between the weights and the biases right and this is what i am trying to do right so i.
