but you could just take care of that by using some kind of an early stopping or something right so.
now let's see what this uh cosine early annealing look likes and I just see that so this is what.
cosine annealing look like it has a different formula again this is just based on a cosine function so if.
you substitute the time step T the value of T here right and your capital T would just be the.
period of the uh uh uh of the wave that you have uh and if you substitute these values you.
will get the effective learning rate right and it's better to just show this as the graph and that you.
you'll understand what is happening here so ETA Max is the maximum value for the learning rate ETA mean is.
the minimum value T is the current Epoch and capital t is the restart interval which is until what time.
you increase and then again restart right so that's what capital t is and so let's see what happens so.
