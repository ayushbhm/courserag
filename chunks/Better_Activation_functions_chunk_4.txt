uh the brown points from the blue points right without giving me a high error so that is not possible.
right so uh the reason uh deep neural network can learn such arbitrary boundaries and hence act as a universal.
approximator right because now we have a very complex function between Y and X which is looking like this right.
this is the function that we are interested in and as we had seen while looking at the universal approximation.
theorem and the illustrative proof of it where we are drawn these towers we could do that because we had.
a lean a non-linear layer it what the theorem said is that if you have even a single sigmoid layer.
then you can then the then the network can act as a universe Universal approximator so sigmoid was important there.
right so these non-linearities are what give deep neural networks their power right so there's nothing new that I have.
said we have already discussed this but I just wanted to quickly refresh it because it's relevant for the discussion.
