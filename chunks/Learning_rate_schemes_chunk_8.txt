0.5 right and that's exactly what I get at time step t equal to 20. similarly you could substitute the.
value 30 here and you will get uh this as the value right somewhere here as the value right so.
that's that's how you compute this cyclically running rate the increase keep increasing the again decrease keep increasing then again.
decrease right so this is uh it was almost like having like a very uh simplistic idea right you are.
just saying that at some points I want the learning rate to increase at some points I want the learning.
rate to decrease and to make this happen you we had all these complex algorithms which were adapting the learning.
Aid according to when it should increase when it decreased now this is like a very uh Baseline idea right.
you wanted to increase you wanted to decrease just make it cyclically and if you're in a bad part you.
just have to wait out that cycle and then again you might if you want a smaller learning rate it.
