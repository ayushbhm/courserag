summation of e raised to all a i's right so it depends on all the ais because all the ai.
ali's appear in the denominator right so it's a function of all the allies right this is how we had.
uh computed it right so this this should be clear uh that now we are trying to take the derivative.
of y hat l with respect to a l i and hence it's a function of all the variables okay.
so now that we have understood this and we understood what the final formula for y hat l is let's.
try to find it so let's try to derive this okay okay so this is what we are trying to.
do right we are trying to compute the derivative of the loss function with respect to one of the elements.
in the al vector okay now this is going to be and i've already established that y hat l depends.
on all the a's right so i it's not going to be the case of 1 in some cases and.
0 in other cases right that the derivative is 0 in some cases and not 0 in some cases the.
