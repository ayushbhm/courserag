differentiable right so this is a differentiable function that we are dealing with and this differentiable function may have any.
shape right it could have a shape like this it could have any shape it just smooth and differentiable right.
and what Taylor series does is it gives us a way of approximating this using polynomials of degree n right.
and the higher the degree the better the approximation now this part may not be clear right what do I.
mean by approximate using polynomials of degree N I should have circled n also that part is not clear and.
we'll fix that right let's try to understand what we mean by that okay so I'll delete some of of.
this okay so here's a function right so let's assume this is my w I have a single parameter for.
a use of explanation and this is my loss function right this is L of w suppose okay and what.
it's saying is that as W increases L seems to increase right so that's that's okay whatever this function is.
