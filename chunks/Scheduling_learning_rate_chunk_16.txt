of these values uh so it would be uh or even 0 0 means there is no momentum of course.
so beta Max would be one of these values so now in this case it would be minimum of say.
0.5 and 0.9 so your momentum would be around 0.5 okay and as you keep increasing now at time step.
t equal to 250 uh this would evaluate to log of 1 plus 1 which would be log of 2.
so this would become 1 so you will have 2 raised to minus 1 minus 1 which would be 2.
raised to minus 2 which would become 0.25 so this would be 1 minus 0.25 which is equal to 0.75.
so it would be minimum of 0.75 and beta Max so again beta max if it is something in the.
range of 0.9 then this would be selected right and now you can keep substituting the values of T so.
now if T is equal to 750 then this would be log of uh 3 plus 1 which would be.
log of 4 right and that would be 2 so this will become 2 raised to minus 3 which would.
be 0.125 and then this would become 0.875 so as you can see you are slowly increasing the momentum uh.
