because if each of these is five and two dimensional then you concatenate you will keep going larger right and.
typically you use eight heads so now if each of this is five and two dimensional and then you concat.
it in them then you'll get a four zero nine six dimensional output here which is two larger because it.
increases the size of the parameters that will go through a linear transformation and so on right so typically what.
you do is if you want five and two dimensional size here right then you make sure that your each.
of your eight heads gives you a 64 dimensional output so when you concatenate then you get a five and.
two dimensional output so you start with the five and two dimensional output you adjust these Dimensions such that you.
get a 64 dimensional output at each of these heads you have eight such heads so when you concatenate them.
you'll again get a five and two dimensional output then you do an appropriate linear transformation you could choose this.
