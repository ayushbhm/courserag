these plots also so let's understand these plots so when we don't have bias correction you see that your learning.
rates are higher right there on this scale you have values which are 2 2.5 and so on whereas when.
you use bias correction your learning rates initially are smaller and then initially the learning rate was uh large uh.
and then it starts decaying and in the case of I battum with bias correction so remember this brown or.
the red curve actually corresponds to the learning rate for w and W was the direction which was sparse so.
as it uh came close to the Minima and it went into the valley it still had to make some.
updates for w so the learning rate was still increasing which is what we would want right so this atom.
with bias correction was able to adjust easier whereas this guy had some initial very high learning rate and then.
it had to follow some trajectory of course both of them converged that is not a problem but this is.
