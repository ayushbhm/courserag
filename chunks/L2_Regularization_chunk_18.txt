get H inverse h w star so in that case my w tilde is actually equal to W star and.
that should indeed be the case right because if Alpha is 0 that means my second term was not this.
if the second term was not there then I'm just left with my original loss function and for the original.
loss function I had already defined that the optimal is W star so if I'm going to get rid of.
alpha if Alpha is equal to 0 then even for the regularized loss which is just equal to the original.
loss my w tilde equal to W Star right so simple uh observation but just trying to make the point.
clear okay now we are of course not interested in the case of alpha not equal to zero we are.
interested in the case when Alpha is not equal to zero right because we are using regularization and in that.
case we want to see what is the solution between W tilde and W star okay so let's go ahead.
so since H is a symmetric positive semi-definite Matrix we know that its eigenvalue decomposition will exist not just that.
