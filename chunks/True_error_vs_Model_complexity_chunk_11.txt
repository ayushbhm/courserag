0 in the case of training data is actually equal to this quantity and now we see that this quantity.
has this sensitivity term which says that if the small change in y i what happens to the change in.
F hat and we are making this observation that this quantity would be high for complex models because a small.
change in y I was causing a lot of changes in the estimated value of f hat X or the.
estimated values of the parameters whereas for simple models it was not causing a lot of change right so connecting.
these observations now we can say that this quantity that you see here is actually going to be high for.
complex models as compared to simple models right ah in complex model would be more changes so just to ah.
so what does that eventually mean right so on the previous slide we had that true error is equal to.
empirical train error plus a small constant plus some term and now we are seeing that this term is actually.
