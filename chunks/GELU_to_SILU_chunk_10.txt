less than or equal to X right that's how what that's what Phi of X means right so if I.
were to draw the cumulative density function then if I were to this is my x axis so if I.
take any X I'll get a value here and this value is essentially the P of X taking on values.
less than or equal to x z because it has been obtained by the integration of this curve and then.
till this point whatever was the area under the density curve that is what gets plotted here right so this.
is just probability of X less than or equal to X right and now this I could uh since this.
this is the probability density function of the uh of the normal distribution I know how to compute this there.
are certain approximations available for that and I can use those approximations right so what my FX actually is I.
can write F of uh I can write this quantity okay let me just draw the other one so so.
I can write this quantity okay you ignore the X here because this x corresponds to this x right so.
