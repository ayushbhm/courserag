arbitrary degree of precision right so that's what we have been able to do so now what will happen is.
the 2d 2d towers that i got out of that tower network i can put many of these together right.
and construct my uh function as way i desire right and i can adjust for the thickness of the towers.
to make it more and more a better approximation right so that's the idea so this is what the universal.
approximation theorem says and the reason it is important is that in real world you will have these complex arbitrary.
functions and now you have a way of coming up with a neural network it still has a large number.
of neurons right and we'll fix that it has a large number of neurons but if you keep that fact.
aside you can what this theorem says that for any function that you have any problem that you're dealing with.
where there's a true function x and let it be as arbitrary a function as you want right you can.
