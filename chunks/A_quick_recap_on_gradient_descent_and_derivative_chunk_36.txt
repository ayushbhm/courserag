to happen right so the problem that you want to solve is that in regions where you have a gentle.
slope you should be able to move faster right so we'll try to solve that problem but before that we'll.
perhaps take a D2 let me see what we have planned yeah so we uh okay so then what I'll.
do is I'll end this video here it's already been a long video and when we come back we'll first.
take a D2 try to understand what contos are uh then look at gradient distance in the context of Contours.
and then try to solve the problem that we just described which is on flat surfaces gradient descent moves very.
slowly okay thank you.
