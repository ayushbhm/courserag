and it is a lot of distance to cover uh to reach the Minima right and you can see that.
I've already exhausted my 100 iterations it's done I've done with 100 iterations but I have not been able to.
reach the Minima which would have been somewhere here right so so that did not happen maybe if I ran.
for 200 300 400 so you can go back and experiment and see how many iterations it takes and this.
looks a bit frustrating right because you know that you're almost there you just need to run faster and get.
there right but you're not able to run faster because the derivatives become small right and this will happen this.
will always happen when you're close to the convergence so when you're close to convergence your surface does not have.
a very high slope and now we are very very very slowly moving towards the Minima which you don't want.
to happen right so the problem that you want to solve is that in regions where you have a gentle.
