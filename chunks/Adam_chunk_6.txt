the other Concepts in the equations of Adam you already know right you already know what VT does it kind.
of decays the learning rate you also know what Mt does right Mt is the classical momentum term the only.
new thing which has come up in Adam is this bias correction right which is not uh clear to us.
why we are doing that bias correction right so let's see why we are doing that bias correction right so.
these are the update equations for uh atom so note that we are taking like a running average of empty.
right we are in in Mt we are taking a running average of the gradients right so what do I.
mean by taking a running average of the gradients like I have the current gradient I'm giving it some weightage.
and I'm also accumulating the history so the reason we are doing this is that we don't want to rely.
too much on the current gradient right because you might get a sudden High gradient and then you might take.
