okay so recall the equation so now one thing which I have done here is that I have so remember.
that you could have beta U T minus 1 plus 1 minus beta times uh Delta WT right so both.
these forms are popular right so where you have beta and 1 minus beta where of course they sum up.
to one or you could just have beta and then no weight multiplied by the derivative of WT right so.
when we had originally introduced momentum we had used this equation but from when you used it in atom we.
were using this equation so both are popular so when I start off I will stick to this but at.
some point I will switch to this equation so just remember that both of these can be used interchangeably right.
so when I start off I'll just use this because it's easier to convey what I want to convey but.
at a later point I'll switch back to the this version of momentum okay um now you recall the equation.
for Mac the main idea in nag was that instead of looking at the gradient at time step T you.
