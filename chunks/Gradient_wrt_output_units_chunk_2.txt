function with respect to the output layer is what i am interested in okay now to begin with right so.
and i know what the loss function is i know that this is minus log of y hat l where.
l is the true class label okay and what i'm going to do is i'm going to focus first on.
the upper half right which is the green dark shaded green portion right so what do i have here i.
have y 1 hat y 2 hat all the way up to y k hat okay and my loss function.
is minus log y hat l that means one of these the negative of the log of one of these.
values which value the one which corresponds to the true class label right so that's what the situation is so.
that's what my loss function is and i'm trying to take its derivative with respect to one of the values.
it could be y one y two all the way up to y k right so now this is what.
i am trying to do i am trying to take the derivative of the loss function which has the term.
y hat l with respect to one of the y i's okay and we know that this log y hat.
