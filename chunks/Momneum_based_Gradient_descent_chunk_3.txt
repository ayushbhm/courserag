uh surface looked like okay this is very gentle slope here so here every step is small right but you.
have been moving along this direction for a long time so what if you accumulate all this and then start.
moving very fast so that you can come out of this uh this gentle region very quickly right so that's.
the idea of momentum gaze gradient descent and we now need to take this uh intuition and convert it into.
an equation right so let's see and this is the same as a ball gains momentum while rolling down a.
slope right so it's slowly moving when it's on the gentle part here right but that it's moving it gains.
momentum and then it starts moving very fast and because one way of looking at it is that it's constantly.
being pushed in that direction so you're also constantly being asked to go in that direction the slope is small.
but the direction is constantly this way you're saying okay go here at every point you are saying go here.
