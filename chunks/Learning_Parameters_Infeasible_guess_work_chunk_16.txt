axis okay and the vertical axis is the error axis right so for all possible values of w and b.
i have just computed the loss i can do that i can do that programmatically and i have just plotted.
it right and this is what the plot looks like okay and you can see that there is this region.
here where the loss is low or minimum right and there are certain regions where the loss is very high.
right so i could just plot this and then i could just pick up some value from this good region.
here and that would what my answer be right and we had seen a similar argument when we're doing the.
perceptron algorithm and we need the know the fallacy of this argument also that this is okay for this toy.
example uh but it will become intractable as the number of data points increasing right so as the number of.
data points increases just computing this loss would be very difficult for all the infinite values of w and b.
