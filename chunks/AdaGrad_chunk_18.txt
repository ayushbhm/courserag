becomes zero then there's no more additions happening right so that's why this will saturate here in this region right.
and that you can see here if you look at the derivative right in that region the derivatives have now.
almost become zero and hence no additions are happening to the history right no large additions are happening to the.
history it is very close to zero so some small small additions are happening but it's not reflecting in the.
uh plot right and uh looking at this also so initially remember that the way your plot was and this.
this itself is interesting and we should try to look at it in the context of the uh now the.
last plot that we had right how is the derivative uh changing so I'll make some comments I'll go back.
to the loss plot and I'll make some comments there and then come back here yes yes and I'm on.
the access x-axis you have the number of iterations right yeah so if I look at the loss plot right.
