but this is okay visually to do but ideally we would want an algorithm such that I don't now I.
can plot this visually for two inputs right but if I had n inputs I can't even plot and visualize.
it right so now I'm looking for an algorithm just as visually by looking at this plot I can find.
out what they write w and W two values are can I have an algorithm which allows me to find.
one such W one W two such that if my input is linearly separable then for that value of w.
and W 2 my positive points would be on the right side and my negative side points would also be.
on the right side right on the correct side or in the right half space right so that's the algorithm.
that we are looking for and that's the perceptron learning algorithm that we will see in the next module thank.
you.
