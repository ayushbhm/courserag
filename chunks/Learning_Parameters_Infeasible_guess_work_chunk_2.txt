you're just changing that notation and i'll stick to this notation for the rest of the course now right yeah.

one right whether this movie are going to like it or not but now i'm going to make it uh.
make it a problem where you're trying to predict a real value instead of a boolean value and you're trying.
to predict the imdb rating on a scale of zero to one right so it could take values like zero.
point zero five point one point two whatever right it could take any of these values so it's a real.
