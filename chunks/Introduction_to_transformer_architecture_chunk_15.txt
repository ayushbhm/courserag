output I'm producing the first word so what is the most important uh set of weights or what is the.
most important words that I need to focus right and then you keep doing this at every time step so.
you could think of is that you had this H1 to H5 weights and then you're multiplying them uh sorry.
the H1 to H5 vector us right so you can think of putting them in a matrix and then you.
have this Vector of Weights so now you're taking the doing this Matrix Vector multiplication which is essentially taking a.
linear combination of all these columns right so alpha 1 1 into this alpha 1 2 into this Alpha One.
three into this and so on right so that's the operation that is happening here and then you get the.
uh you feed it to the decoder RNN which then produces a output at the end right and you keep.
repeating this at every time step you do it at C2 then you compute C3 C4 C5 and so on.
right so you keep doing that now what I'm showing here is what is known as a heat map so.
