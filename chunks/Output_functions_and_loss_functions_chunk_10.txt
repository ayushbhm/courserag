will start doing that so hence that is the reason why it will not learn to predict these high values.
the only way it can get minimize the loss is by staying within that range the moment it goes very.
far from that range it will not uh uh the the loss values would become very high and it will.
be pushed away from those configurations and so the loss will make sure that my values stay in that range.
but if i chosen the logistic function even if the loss is giving me that signal i can't do much.
because no matter what happens the logistic function is only going to give me values between 0 to 1. it.
doesn't matter how i adjust w1 w2 w3 b1 b2 b3 at the end my values are always going to.
be 0 right hence that wouldn't have worked out okay okay so that's what you would do in the case.
of regression now the next thing i'm going to do is talk about classification and to understand the loss function.
