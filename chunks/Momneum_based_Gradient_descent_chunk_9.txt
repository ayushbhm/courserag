moving by a larger amount and that's exactly what you want on the flat surfaces because you're moving slow slow.
slow slow at every time step your movement is slow but if you just accumulate this history then your movement.
would become fast right so that's what is happening here so your UT is just going to be the sum.
of this right so this was at time step two this was just uh you could write this as beta.
2 minus 0 into W 0 then beta 2 minus 1 into W1 plus beta 2 minus 2 into W.
2 right sorry Delta should have been here so that is what this equation is capturing right so this minus.
0 is essentially minus Tau so you're going from time step 0 to time step Tau and at every stage.
your weightage for that gradient is given by Beta T minus beta raised to T minus Tau right so that's.
what u 2 is it's a collection of all the gradients that you have seen so far and this exponentially.
weighted average of current and all pass gradients right as I was saying that if you are currently at time.
