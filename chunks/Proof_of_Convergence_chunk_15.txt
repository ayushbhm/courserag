minus 1 t minus 2 till i reach w naught right and i'll have some multiplier k here right so.
now the question is why is this multiplier k and why is it not t t is the number of.
steps i have taken right but at every step remember i may not have made a correction because for some.
pis that i would have picked the right condition would have been satisfied and i wouldn't have made a correction.
so my k the number of updates which i make is going to be less than equal to t that's.
why i have k here and not t delta so k is a quantity which is less than equal to.
t because every time i make an update this bracket opens up and then i replace some quantity there by.
a delta so this bracket will open up that means this uh this in many cases this pj would not.
have been there right i would have not changed my weight vector so this bracket will open up only that.
many times as many times the condition was violated and the maximum number of times the condition can be violated.
