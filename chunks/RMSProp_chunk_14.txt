say this learning rate becoming constant and then resulting in oscillations so one solution is to set the learning rate.
initial learning rate appropriately right so this ETA that we have so remember our effective learning rate is ETA divided.
by that square root of VT so this ETA that we have in the numerator that's the initial learning rate.
and we could if we set that appropriately then we could solve this oscillation problem right so now for the.
same example I will show you the case where we had set the learning rate initial learning rate to be.
0.05 and now if I uh run this algorithm RMS prop you can see that there are no oscillations here.
right so how does that happen so if you have this ETA set to a right value then in the.
example that I was giving earlier what could happen is that I was showing that this okay maybe let's do.
it again so I was saying that it was perhaps oscillating from this point to this point and then back.
