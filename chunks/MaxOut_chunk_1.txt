when the in the negative region right and so on so we did all that and now we look at.
continue our journey on a more activation functions we'll do around three to four more uh starting with the max.
out activation function right so we'll motivate that uh starting with Dropout and then try to connect it to how.
there is some uh kind of I wouldn't say relationship but some analogy that you could draw from Dropout okay.
so we had discussed about this model averaging where you have a data set and you create sub data sets.
from here by sampling with replacement what do I mean by that so I have say a thousand data points.
okay I want to create another data set of thousand uh data points uh as how I will do that.
is I'll pick one training example from the original data set put it in this bucket right and then keep.
the training example here also it's not being removed so it's not that now you have 999 samples here you.
