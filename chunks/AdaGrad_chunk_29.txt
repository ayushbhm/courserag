for that is that if you don't take the square root then these quantities become very large very quickly right.
and maybe that kills of the learning rate in an unfavorable way right but it's there's no clear theoretical justification.
that I have seen what's the flip side while we got an Adaptive learning rate for W and B the.
flip side is that over time the effective learning rate for B became so small that it was having a.
difficulty in moving in the W Direction in the B direction right so you see that now I was able.
to reach the right value of w right I was able to reach the right value of w that's the.
right value of w because my Minima is also here right so I'm in line with the right value of.
w but I took longer time to find the right value of b as opposed to the other algorithms which.
found the right value of B first and then took a longer time to find the right value of w.
right and this is happening because the history for B has accumulated and the updates in B are now very.
