a plot it will become clear right so if you have a flat surface you will get better regularization why.
why is that the case because if you have a flat surface then for a large range you have the.
loss as the same right and now your if you cannot over fit like I mean in the sense that.
you have figured out a value of the loss you know that for a large neighborhood any of the W's.
would have given you a similar loss right but now in this plot where you have these bumps up and.
down if you had over fit and selected gone into one Valley around that Valley there are many other Hills.
right so with a small change you get a very large change in the loss so your model becomes very.
sensitive right so one effect of regularization that people have shown is that it smoothens the Lost surface right so.
they have analyzed the surface of lost surface of neural networks and seen that with regularization and this was in.
