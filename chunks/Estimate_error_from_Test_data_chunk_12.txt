average computed from the m test points that you had and the test points were the points from n plus.
1 to n plus M I know what the predicted value is I know what the true value is because.
I was given the data as x i comma y i pairs right so I had these pairs I know.
the what the true value is and I just compute this difference and this is of course easy to compute.
this is expectation of Epsilon square and I just told you earlier that explain expectation Epsilon comes from 0 comma.
Sigma Square so expected value of Epsilon square is just the variance which is Sigma Square so Sigma square is.
going to be small so this is a small ah constant that will get added here and then you have.
this third quantity that you still don't know how to deal with right ah so let's just see how to.
deal with that quantity so what I've written here is that this is the covariance between uh these two uh.
values right ah and the yeah so what I've written here is the this this quantity here I mean keeping.
