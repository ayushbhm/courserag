way and at every point the loss will just keep decreasing and I'll reach the minimum that is what is.
going to happen and now let me try to see if I can demonstrate that right I'm just going to.
go here okay okay so this is what my loss function looks like this is actually the same as the.
loss on the previous slide just scaled a bit differently and what I know is that I want to reach.
somewhere here because in this surface it's clear that the error is minimum there but right now I am way.
far I want to reach somewhere here but I am very far my initialization was randomly done right so now.
what I'm going to do is I'm going to run this algorithm and you just observe how the things change.
both on the loss surface you should see that the loss at every step should keep decreasing and the W.
should keep W comma B the point on the yeah on the W comma B plane right so this here.
is the W comma B plane so the W comma B plane I should keep moving till I reach this.
