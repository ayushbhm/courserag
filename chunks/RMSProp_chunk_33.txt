you don't want the sensitivity towards eat or not right because you really want it to adapt and not get.
stuck with an initial choice that you have made because at the start of the algorithm you make this choice.
that Eternal is going to be 0.1 or 0.6 or 0.05 and then you are stuck with that choice right.
instead can I get rid of this ETA naught and have like a more adaptive setup right so all of.
this is trying to make a case for that okay so that's what is being said on the slide also.
and therefore we wish the numerator also to change with respect to the gradient or the current slope right so.
if I'm in a steeper region I want the numerator and denominator to adjust in uh kind of concurrence so.
that I get a good effective learning rate and if I'm in a flat region again I want to want.
them to adjust in kind of correlation so that I have have a good effective learning rate right right now.
