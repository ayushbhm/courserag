the error from the training data this is again a small constant and now we have this quantity here now.
earlier we showed that this quantity becomes 0 because we showed that these two are actually independent and Y were.
those two independent because Epsilon was y minus f of x right and the other quantity was F of f.
hat of x minus f of x and we argued that these y's which are actually coming from the test.
data did not participate in the estimation of hefat hex hence these two quantities were independent of each other right.
but now we cannot make that argument because why which is coming from the training data now has actually participated.
in the estimation of f hat X so now these two quantities are not independent hence Epsilon and this this.
quantity is not independent hence I cannot write this as a product of the expected value of Epsilon multiplied by.
the expected value of this quantity and then this will not become zero hence the whole term will not become.
