is not linearly separable but if i draw i have a function which looks like exactly what has been shown.
here and let me just delete and use a better color you know not black maybe the function is 0.
everywhere here and then 1 here right and then again 1 here and 0 everywhere here 0 everywhere here 0.
everywhere here right so for all the blue points now it is predicting 0. you can see that it's also.
obvious in the 2d version of the figure and for all the orange points it is predicting 1 and that's.
exactly what i want because for the orange points i found oil and for the blue points i did not.
find out right so even in two dimensions you could have this case where you have an arbitrary function now.
this is the shape of the function the entire orange surface that you see is the shape of the true.
function and that's what the true function looks like and now i want to approximate it right and now again.
