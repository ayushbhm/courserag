have lied in the negative half space but there are these two green points which are also lying in negative.
half space so i'm making errors on two inputs so in this configuration my perceptron is not actually representing the.
or function it's not implementing the or function because it is making errors right so this is not an implementation.
of the or function but there could be other values this i already showed i could even adjust the threshold.
right so this w naught actually in the terms of a line tells me what my y intercept is going.
to be right so i'm going to adjust it and it will intersect or intercept the y axis at different.
points right and now so far the error is zero so all these solutions are valid but now if i.
come here then i have a problem you can see error is equal to one because one point which red.
point which should have been in the negative half space is now lying in the positive half space right so.
