[Music] so welcome back uh so in the previous module we looked at this typical machine learning supervised machine learning.
setup and the key there was to now come up with a algorithm for learning the parameters right so what.
we'll do is now start with an infeasible algorithm right which will not really work in practice but it will.
give us intuitions about how what should we do to make it i mean go towards the more practical approach.
right so let's start so this is the supervised machine learning setup that i have i have n inputs okay.
and i have some weights and then i have the output now this is the model right this is my.
approximation of the relation between y and f y and x right so this is f hat actually this is.
the model and now i want to know an algorithm okay which can be used to learn the parameters of.
this model given the data that is would be given to me and using some objective function which makes sense.
