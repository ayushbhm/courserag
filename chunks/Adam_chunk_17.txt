can just it's it does not depend on the time safety anymore right so I can take it outside the.
summation so then I have 1 minus beta into expected value of delta W into that summation that I had.
now this summation looks familiar it's a summation of a series and this is beta raised to T minus 1.
plus beta raised to T minus 2 all the way up to Beta 0 and the sum of that series.
is just going to be 1 minus beta T divided by 1 minus beta raised to T divided by 1.
minus beta of course so now I get this equation so the expected value of Mt is actually the expected.
value of the derivative into 1 minus beta T so now if I had taken the expected value of m.
t by 1 minus beta T then I would have got the expected value of the grade right hence I.
need this bias correction I am just dividing the value of m t why this term 1 minus beta T.
because if I do that now this is actually my empty hat so now what this is telling me is.
