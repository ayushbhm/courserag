here you can see that the distance between the contour lines is very smaller as compared to the distance between.
the contour lines along this direction so this is the W1 Direction and this is the W2 Direction what does.
that tell us that along this w n axis even if I change the weight a lot I'm not losing.
much in terms of my loss right so I have more flexibility here if I want to shrink the weights.
then I have a better chance of shrinking this weight because whatever is the optimum value for this weight even.
if I shrink it my loss is going to shrink a bit more slowly because there's a higher gap between.
the contour lines here so the loss is not rapidly changing along this direction but along the W2 Direction you.
can see that the loss is rapidly changing so now if I ever to aggressively shrink W2 that even for.
small shrinks in W2 my loss will go increase right and that is not not acceptable to me because I.
