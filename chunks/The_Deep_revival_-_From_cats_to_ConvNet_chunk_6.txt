as convolutional neural networks or the Deep learning way of doing things right and similar uh inroads also started happening.
in the field of NLP and speech right slowly deep neural networks started penetrating and overtaking or rather replacing all.
the older methods right so this is like the golden period where everyone of course maybe you could say that.
the golden period is now where even just talks about deep learning and nothing else but this is the time.
where the real boom or the shift happened and you could talk of this as a transition uh period 2012.
to 2016 right so while we are talking about the success on image Network right what image net data set.
the key deep Learning Network there was what are known as convolutional neural networks and this section is interestingly titled.
as from cats to convolutional neural networks so let's see if I use that title so again going back 1959.
