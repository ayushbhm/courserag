the idea is that you have a sequence of inputs and you want to have some interaction between these inputs.
right so for example when i'm talking it's not that every phoneme or every microsecond of speech can be ah.
a millisecond of speech can be analyzed independently it has some connection to what i just spoke previously right so.
i should have networks which are aware that such dependency between the inputs or interactions between the inputs are useful.
and should allow for those interactions right so the jordan network which is one time of recurrent neural network allowed.
the output at each time step to be fed as input for the next time step and that will allow.
interactions between different times so think of a sequence of images or sequence of frames which forms a video and.
you want to do some kind of video classification at the end so it's important that every sequence interacts with.
