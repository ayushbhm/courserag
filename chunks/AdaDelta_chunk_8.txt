just going to focus on the U's and the v's okay so now if you look at this at this.
time step right yeah so when I was here at t equal to 2 time step I will use U1.
divided by V 2 right so this is my U1 and this is my V2 and you can compare these.
two equations and you will know that U1 is actually smaller than V2 right so if U1 is smaller than.
V2 then the numerator is smaller than the denominator and hence the effective learning rate would be small and hence.
my problem has been taken care of right in the Steep region I am having a smaller denominator a smaller.
effective learning rate right that's exactly what I wanted and the entire picture will become clear also when I talk.
about what happens in the flat regions right so that's also something which is coming so let's wait for that.
to happen so both VT and UT are increasing right because both are accumulating gradients but because of this one.
