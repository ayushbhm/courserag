dependent on the bias and the variance also so if you have a model which has a high bias like.
the simple model then your expected error on the test set is going to be high if you have a.
model which has a high variance like this High degree polynomial that you had then again your error on the.
test set is going to be high so what you need for this quantity to be small you need the.
bias also to be small and the variance also to be small and the intuition that we just developed is.
that these are contradictory right you cannot have both you will either have a high bias and low variance or.
you will have a low bias and high variance so somewhere in Middle you have to find the sweet spot.
where you have medium bias and medium variance that would give you the minimum error that you are seeking on.
the test data right so that's the connection between bias variance and the expected test error or the mean square.
