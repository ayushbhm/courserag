two points as opposed to a slightly better loss oscillation where it's perhaps oscillating between two low loss regions right.
so that's not happening here you can clearly see that it's oscillating between very high loss regions right so from.
one high loss point to another it is going and you can see that because this where it is stable.
I mean the point of oscillation this is what the sigmoid curve looks like which is nowhere close to fitting.
the points that I have right now let's look at the other example here the learning rate is slow so.
you can see that the curve is moving slowly right the algorithm is progressing slower to the Minima and now.
in this case also there are oscillations this is still not good in fact ETA not equal to 0.05 is.
what I had shown on the previous slide was good so even with ETA not equal to 0.1 the learning.
rate is still high right so the numerator is still high so this is now point one this is still.
