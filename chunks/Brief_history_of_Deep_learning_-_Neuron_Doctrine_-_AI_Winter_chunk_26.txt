this was discovered or proposed by koshi and for a very different purpose right and he was trying to use.
gradient descent to compute the orbit of heavenly body so there's a lot of interest in astronomy at that time.
and he was trying to look at what is the orbit of heavenly bodies and in that context he had.
discovered gradient distance right so again whatever benefits we are enjoying today they come through the work of many great.
scientists over centuries in different fields and that's where that has helped us reach where we are today right in.
very unexpected uh ways so while we were still in this winter period again this 1989 what came up is.
this universal approximation theorem which is again something that will come up in the course right and what this said.
again to repeat what i said earlier that if you have a function which takes certain x as input and.
gives you y and in real world you don't know what this f is right so in real world if.
