small change in the data right but when would this quantity be high if this quantity is high it means.
that if you have even a small change in y i you are seeing a very large change in your.
F hat which means you are changing a very large change in the W's that you have estimated right and.
this is not good right this is definitely not good because for this much small change you don't want the.
model to vary a lot right and for what kind of models we saw that this happens that a small.
change in the data could lead to a large change in the F hat x that you got this is.
what we saw in the case of when we were discussing the first example of simple and complex models so.
when we had the simple model of Y is equal to W and X plus W naught and then when.
we trained it we had a total of 500 training samples and then when we trained it using 30 different.
samples this line did not change much right that means my f hat X did not change much right but.
