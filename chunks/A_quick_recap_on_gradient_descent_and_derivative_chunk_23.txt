then on the smooth surfaces you are moving slowly that means your Delta W is small that's why you're moving.
slowly why should that be the case we will see that on the Steep surfaces you are moving fast because.
your Delta W is larger why should that be larger on the Steep surfaces that is something that we'll see.
now okay so that's the context and with that I'll just go back and play the video again right I'll.
just want you to observe that indeed when when you are on the smooth surfaces the movement is very very.
slow but when you come to the yeah so when you're on the smooth surfaces the movement is indeed very.
slow but when you come to the uh steep surfaces the movement becomes fast right so I'm going to to.
play the video again and observe that what happens when I transition from this red region here to jumping into.
the valley right you will see that there's a certain fast movement there just make sure you observe that okay.
