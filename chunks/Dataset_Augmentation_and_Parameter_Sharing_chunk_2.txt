that you have seen and there are many such more augmentations in the possible in case of image classification the.
label does not change so I can create a lot of data for free from the data that was queued.
and now how does this help so now you have more training data and now it's no longer enough for.
the network to kind of uh overfit that okay whenever I see this combination of pixels I will mark it.
as two because now that will not work for this guy because now the pixels have changed a bit the.
orientation of the pixels have changed and so on so this this will not uh it cannot easily overfit right.
it has a harder task so you have given it much more training data that it has to by heart.
now right it has to memorize now and that will make it uh make it less prone to overfitting right.
because there's just so much to learn that it cannot hold over fit possibly on all of this of course.
