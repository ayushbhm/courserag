the derivative of this quantity and the derivative of this quantity as we saw on the previous slide was just.
Alpha W right so again nothing new that I have written here but now what I'm going to do is.
I'm going to try to use this value instead of this quantity here right that's the main change I am.
going to do as I go ahead okay now let there be another W which is the optimal solution for.
the regularized loss right so now if there's such a w tilde exist then the derivative of the loss function.
at that point would be zero right and now we have seen that the derivative of the loss function at.
any point was given by this formula we just saw this on the previous slide so I've just substituted that.
formula instead of this formula and instead of the generic W I have substituted W tilde right that's the only.
change that I have done here right yeah again I'm just doing a lot of steps but there's nothing much.
