and you went in that direction and then you later had to course correct and come back whereas when you're.
looking at the full uh gradient you're always moving in the right direction that you need to go to but.
of course you still see oscillations that is there because of the momentum related oscillations you're moving too fast and.
hence you have to oscillate in the green curve right okay okay so now let's look at uh nag also.
okay so stochastic version of nag so now I have all three I have nestorov right and you can see.
the expected Behavior it's all the three algorithms are the stochastic versions of the algorithms therefore even the vanilla gradient.
descent you still see oscillations there those oscillations are because of the stochastic nature of the updates in momentum as.
well as nestrov you see some oscillations as we are going again ahead again because of the stochastic version of.
