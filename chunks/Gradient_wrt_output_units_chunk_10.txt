i've just introduced a new notation for the vector e right okay ah so so far so good right so.
what have we been able to do so far remember that this was h3 this part was h3 which was.
the same as y hat sorry i should have written h 3 in the suffix right so i have the.
derivative of the loss function with respect to y hat but that is not the quantity that i was interested.
in i was interested in the derivative of the loss function with respect to a 3 right or a l.
because l equal to 3 in this case right so that i have not done yet but what i have.
done the reason i did this part was to give you the uh give you like with help of a.
smaller example right try to explain how this entire discussion is going to go what did we do we first.
computed the partial derivative with respect to one of the elements so we were actually interested in the partial in.
the gradient with respect to the entire vector but we didn't go there directly we first computed the partial derivative.
