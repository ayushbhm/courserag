that doesn't matter if you keep the ETA small then your approximations would be good right and now if I.
make a quadratic approximation right I'll just remove the linear one and just keep the quadratic approximation uh I think.
you're not able to see it yeah so here's the quadratic approximation right and now even if I increase the.
W the window a bit you can see that my approximation is still quite good right so that's the idea.
here in fact the original function itself is uh quadratic in various parts right so that's why my approximation is.
quite good right so that's uh that's that's the idea here so the original function is of course 0.5 sine.
X Plus 0.25 sine y but what I meant it in some parts it's Contra I mean it's looking like.
quadratic function right so if you do a quadratic approximation it still would be very uh good right so you.
can do this whether you have a one variable function or a two variable function of course three variable functions.
