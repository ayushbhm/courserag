[Music] so in this module now we'll focus a bit more on this uh boolean functions and when are they.
linearly separable and not linear separate the reason that we want to delve into this is that we just saw.
that the perceptron model or the even the perceptron learning algorithm only has guarantees when the data is linearly separable.
so now what are these linearly separable boolean functions or rather what are boolean functions which are not linearly separable.
so that's something that we want to understand right so let us see one such simple example and this is.
a famous xor function that all of you know about so this is what the xor function looks like and.
now let's see what happens right so if i want to implement this using a perceptron then these are the.
four inequalities that my weights should satisfy right so for 0 0 inputs when i plug in this formula the.
output should be less than 0 for 0 1 0 it should be greater than equal to 0 for 0.
