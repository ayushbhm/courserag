be 0 then the derivative is going to be 0. so if the derivative is 0 again you have this.
problem that when you are trying to update W1 at some point in the chain you have this derivative of.
H1 with respect to A1 and that derivative is going to be 0 right which means the derivative of the.
loss function with respect to W 1 W 2 is going to be 0 right now if and also with.
respect to B is going to be 0. so now if that happens the neuron of course output at zeros.
or the neurons output was Zero which means it was a dead neuron which is fine if it's dead for.
this training example I can live with it right but now it's not got updated neither has B got an.
update right and now from here on what will happen is that the neuron will remain dead for the rest.
of the training it will never become alive again right so why is that the case so this is all.
just the explanation that I gave in uh just I was speaking through it this is all on the slides.
