you will be sure that this term that was bothering you is going to be reduced right so this actually.
is the basis for all regularization methods right so this is what you do in regularization instead of just minimizing.
L train Theta which is the empirical training error you actually add some regularization term to that and then you.
see that I am going to minimize the empirical train error as well as the regularization error because that will.
make sure that my expected error which is what I was interested in is actually going to be small right.
and the pictorial view of this this is the same so this is what would happen if I were to.
just look at the training error right so this is L train which is computed just using those n training.
samples then my as I keep increasing the model complexity this will keep decreasing but what will happen is as.
I increase the model complexity this quantity is going to increase and hence my error is actually going to be.
