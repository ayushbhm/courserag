you are kind of re-estimating uh the average in the case of empty you're writing it as beta into Mt.
minus 1 plus 1 minus beta into the current uh derivative right so the current derivative is this one blue.
point that you have instead of relying on that blue point you are also taking an exponentially weighted average of.
the history so this is your way of kind of uh accounting for the fact that the current batch could.
be uh noisy so hence let me look at the history also and kind of re-estimate this point right now.
if you don't do bias correction so now what I'm going to do is that for every black point I.
am going to compute the new value of that Black Point using this equation that means I'm going to compute.
this weighted history right so at time step 40 I have 39 Blue Points below it and I'm going to.
take the value of each of those 39 blue points and I will say that beta raised to 39 into.
