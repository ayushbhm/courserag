cost beta is now let's just try to expand this right so i'll now look at the numerator alone uh.
let me just get rid of some stuff here so the numerator is uh w star the dot product between.
w star and w t plus one remember that w star and w t plus one are weight vectors right.
these are vectors so i can talk about the dot product and now i can just substitute the value of.
w t plus 1 which is nothing but w t plus p i which is again of course a vector.
it's the addition of two vectors now i'm going to open up these brackets so i get w star the.
dot product between w star and w t and the dot product between w star and p i okay now.
i'm going to define a new quantity so let me just explain something before i define that quantity so i.
have the points p1 p2 all the way up to some pm right these are all the points which belong.
to my p prime okay now i can compute the dot product between each of these points and w star.
