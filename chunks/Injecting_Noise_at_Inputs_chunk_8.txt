C so I have grouped them so I have a minus B plus sorry A minus C plus this B.
quantity and of course there was the whole Square outside always okay so now this now Becomes of the form.
let me just say p plus Q the whole Square so it is going to be p square plus Q.
squared plus 2 p q so it is going to be the expectation of p square plus Q squared plus.
2 PQ this is an expectation of a sum so I can write it as the sum of expectations so.
expectation of P Square expectation of 2pq and expectation of our Q square right now let's make a few observations.
so this quantity here there are n terms here right so you could think of it as a 1 plus.
a two plus plus all the way up to a n square right so now when you expand this what.
are the kind of terms that you are going to get you are going to get the squares of all.
of these guys A1 square plus a 2 square all the way up to a n square and then you.
are going to get these uh and choose two terms where you will have a 1 a 2 of course.
