problems involving sequences so let's look at what these problems are so you encounter sequences everywhere right so okay so.
we encounter sequences everywhere right if you beat videos or if you have speech a speech is like a sequence.
of uh phonemes right and we need to do speech processing we need to do video processing and these are.
all inputs here are naturally sequenced right so we need sequence processing angles of course this need were discovered i.
mean reid was realized long back and he as is the case with convolutional neural networks very long back in.
1982 we had something known as an off field network i'm not going to the details of it it's not.
something that we'll cover in the course also but it was something which was able to uh do some kind.
of a sequence processing right more relevant to this course is this what is known as recurrent neural networks where.
the idea is that you have a sequence of inputs and you want to have some interaction between these inputs.
