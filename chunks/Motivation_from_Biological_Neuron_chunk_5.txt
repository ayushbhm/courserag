takeaway here is that there's like this massive network of interconnected neurons which are interacting with each other arranged in.
layers one layer activating the neurons in the other layer and so on and this layered architecture is something that.
we'll see frequently through the course right and when i say it's a massively parallel interconnected network i really mean.
it right because it has the average human brain has around 10 raised to 11 that is 100 billion neurons.
right and in this massive network there's also natural division of work right so each neuron may not perform all.
the tasks that humans perform like each neuron may not be responsible for processing visual information as well as auditory.
information as well as other information right it might just take care of certain information right and one way to.
demonstrate uh this so i'll just first again illustrate with the cartoon and then go to a more real example.
