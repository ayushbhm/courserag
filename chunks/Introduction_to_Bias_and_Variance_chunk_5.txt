this right just for illustration I have taken points from sinusoidal functions so that's it's easy for me to illustrate.
what the true function is and how good or bad my approximation is right so now in a typical deep.
learning machine learning setup I am going to talk about different approximations right so I will take one very simple.
approximation and then one slightly complex approximation and then I'll try to make some comments based on the approximations that.
I have made right so let's ah see how that goes okay yeah so we consider two models so one.
is a simple model as I said degree one model where I assume that Y is related to X using.
a linear function right so I just assumed that Y is equal to MX plus C or Y is equal.
to W and X plus W naught right so I have only two parameters here clearly not an over parameterized.
model and the relationship that I have assumed is very simple the other I am going to assume is a.
