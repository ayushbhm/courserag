headed so now if we place it by Max then what it boils down to is that we're just going.
to take the max of these quantities right and that in turn will just boil down to whatever we had.
at the previous time step because you're taking the max let's say you're already taking the max of these two.
guys uh when you are at time step two you have taken the max of these two guys and retained.
one of those then again whatever was the max that you took at time step 3 and retain one of.
those right so then it just becomes like taking a pairwise Max whatever you had at time step T minus.
1 the history that multiplied by meter and the max with the next guy right so that's all we are.
doing notice that here we are not scaling uh the gradient by 1 minus beta right so that's a change.
that we have made right so then essentially now this becomes the L Infinity Norm of the history of the.
