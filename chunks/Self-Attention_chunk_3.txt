values are sorry so I'll first do a linear transformation with WQ to get a new Vector which is I'm.
going to call as the Q by Q Vector so this is going to be the q1 similarly I'll do.
a linear transformation with K and I'll call it as K1 similarly I'll do a linear transformation with v and.
I'm going to call it as VR right now how I'm going to use this q1 K1 V1 doesn't matter.
right but at least pectorially you get to know what is happening here I had one vector I did three.
linear transformations to get three different vectors from that I am calling them as q1 K1 V1 I'll continue the.
same for all the uh all my words in the input all of this can be done in parallel of.
course so I'll again take the last word for example I'll do this for all the word but I'm just.
showing it for the last word again so I'll take uh H Phi in this case pass it through WQ.
and I'll get my Q Phi similarly I'll get K Phi and similarly I'll get V5 right so if I.
