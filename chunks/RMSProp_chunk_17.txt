it is sensitive to the learning rate and setting this learning rate to 0.05 and showing you that it converges.
is not to give the message that hey you could do this by setting the learning rate appropriately it is.
just to show that different learning initial learning rates could have different effects right so that's the idea here and.
we'll have to move to a stage where we kind of get to algorithms which are not too sensitive to.
the initial learning rate okay which one ha so VT plus Epsilon so V T is initially 0 so initially.
it would be ETA divided by square root of 10 raised to minus 4 right okay now let's see again.
just continuing in that direction right so if we uh were to initialize ETA with different values right so I.
have suppose ETA equal to Eta not equal to 0.6 that's what I should say so our effective learning rate.
is ETA ETA naught divided by square root of VT plus Epsilon and of course this ETA naught remains constant.
