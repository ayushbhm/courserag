in this territory as we go to sigmoid neurons and then eventually to a deep neural networks right so that's.
where we're slowly making a transition to right so let us first revisit some boolean functions to convince ourselves that.
this is actually drawing a linear decision boundary right so you have the or function i know what the or.
function looks like and now in terms of the perceptron what does it mean this is what my perceptron function.
is right so i'm going to take a weighted sum of the two inputs plus w naught and i want.
that to be less than zero in this case right i want that to be greater than equal to zero.
in this case greater than equal to zero in this case greater than equal to zero in this case because.
that's how my or function is right now let me just expand this right so what is this first guy.
is telling w naught plus w 1 into 0 plus w 2 into 0 should be less than 0 which.
