everything that I need for that is already compute right I'll just explain that intuition again so I started by.
Computing the derivative of the loss function with respect to a 3 right that is the first thing that I.
did and there was nothing special about A3 it was the activation at the output layer now when I want.
to compute this okay let me just do this on the previous slide Maybe yeah so I started by Computing.
the derivative of the loss function with respect to A3 so this I had already done right then I wanted.
to compute the derivative of the loss function with respect to h 2 and I was all set because I.
need W3 for that and I need the derivative of the loss function with respect to A3 which I had.
already computed right so I am ready to compute derivative of H2 so this part is done I have now.
been able to compute this then I wanted to compute the derivative of a 2 with respect to the loss.
