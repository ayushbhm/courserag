over the next few slides to get this picture uh clear of what I mean by K linear Transformations right.
so this is what happens in Dropout right we're still trying to compare Dropout and see what was happening there.
so in Dropout what happens is uh I can divide this nodes in this hidden layer right uh this was.
the hidden layer I am dividing nodes into three parts one is the black nodes which have been dropped out.
so they are completely not participating in the uh uh in the output right they are not participating in the.
computation at all and then there are two types of nodes one are strongly responding nodes and the others are.
weakly responding notes and now in the case of Dropout irrespective whether you're strongly responding or weakly responding the gradients.
do flow back to you right and the gradients will of course flow back in proportion but you're still all.
of you are being responsible for the output and the certain nodes may not maybe get spatialized for the specific.
