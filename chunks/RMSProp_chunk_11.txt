right and after across 500 iterations I have plotted the uh gradients here and this is what is uh happening.
and you have this oscillation around the Minima so if the learning rate is constant so now we have made.
a case that the learning rate could become constant now if the learning rate becomes constant why should there be.
oscillations right why could there be oscillation so let's try to see an explanation for that right suppose let me.
take a simple example this is what my curve is okay and now suppose I was here okay at this.
point okay suppose I was at this point uh yeah and I computed the derivative so this slope will give.
me the derivative and I made the update and after the update so let me just see I'm on the.
W axis I was here and I added the I mean I moved in the direction oppose it to the.
gradient and I ended up here right now again I compute the derivative here again I'll move in the direction.
