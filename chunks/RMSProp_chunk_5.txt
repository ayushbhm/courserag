see that now instead of only one line has changed right so VW plus DW Square I am doing beta.
into VW plus 1 minus beta into DW square right so that's the main change that I've done and now.
let me just play this okay yeah so you can see that RMS prop is now the yellow curve is.
RMS prop which is quickly reads the minimum right because its learning rate is not decaying and it's also following.
this hypotenuse part as I wanted right it's making updates in the direction of w and B uh proportionately even.
though the updates in the direction of w are smaller right but notice something and we'll come back to what.
you notice here oops okay just play it in the minimized version here so it's reached there uh quickly but.
now it's oscillating a bit around the Minima right so you can see the sigmoid curve it had reached the.
solution right all the points were lying on the sigmoid curve but then the yellow curve started oscillating there now.
