foreign [Music] ER and we start looking at the decoder right so the decoder of course operates in the sequence.
here it will operate sequentially because it generates one output then that output feeds in as the input while generating.
the next output and so on right so now what does the decoder look like right so the decoder of.
course takes input from the encoder also so as I said the output of the encoder is E1 up to.
e t right this layer so this is of course fed as the decode right because the decoder needs the.
context of what the input was what is it translating right so that contextual representation you have captured at the.
last layer and that you feed to the decoder so the decoder is going to get inputs from the encoder.
it's also going to have his self inputs right which is the inputs of the words that have been decoded.
so far right so it'll have these two types of inputs and let's see how it deals with these two.
