these are two vectors that I have I have still not shown why I came from here to here right.
that will become clear in a while why did I start discussing about these two just assume that these two.
are the vectors given to you right now what is the uh dot product of these two vectors going to.
be I'm going to take the dot product of these two vectors so it's going to be this multiplied by.
this this multiplied by this all the way up to this multiplied by this and the summation of those right.
so they are going to be K terms in the summation and every term in the summation is going to.
look like the product of these two quantities right so this quantity that you have here is essentially the dot.
product between the jth column of the W of the weight vector and this gradient Vector which you had already.
computed right so that's all it says this is the same formula that I have here and again this is.
