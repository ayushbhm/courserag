with respect to B again I have a function written for that and the same idea that I want to.
compute this f of x which I'll compute from this function here by substituting the current values of w b.
and X that I am dealing with right okay so far so good let me just erase it okay and.
then I'm going to sum this over all the points right because I visited the first point which was x.
equal to 0.5 and Y is equal to 2.5 then the loop will go to the second point this Loop.
will go over all points and I'm just collecting all the uh I'm just adding up all the derivatives because.
as I said the this derivative of a sum is just the sum of the derivatives right once I've computed.
the derivatives I'm just going to apply the gradient descent formula which is W is equal to W minus ETA.
into W did the DW and B is equal to B minus ETA into d w DB right so this.
is I'll just keep doing this in the loop and I'll keep moving along the error surface so this is.
