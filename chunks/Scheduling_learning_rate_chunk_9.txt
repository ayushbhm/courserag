epochs right after every five epochs or ten epochs I'll keep having the learning array right so as you are.
training is progressing your learning rate is becoming smaller and smaller so you're making more conservative updates especially when you.
are closer to the Minima you're not making a large update so that you cross the minimum right and your.
approximation for here I am close to the Minima is just that hey I've been training for five epochs now.
so maybe let me just reduce the learning rate so you're just using the number of epochs as an approximation.
for how close you are to the uh Minima that you want to use right reach another strategy is that.
you keep the learning rate uh you had finished one Epoch you compute the loss over your validation data right.
so you have the training data using which you are training keep some data aside and now after you have.
done one Epoch calculate what the validation loss is and let's say the value is some X okay now with.
