foreign [Music] methods are good right so what does that mean that if we average the output of several models.
then it always helps right but now in the context of deep neural networks this is of course a challenge.
right so if you have to train several large neural networks then it is going to be prohibitively expensive right.
because then you are going to combine these neural networks but then you have to train so many of those.
right and what uh there are two options here right one is you train several neural networks having different architectures.
so that's what I've shown in the first figure here where you have all of these are neural networks but.
they have different architectures or the other option is that you have the same neural network same architecture rather and.
you're going to train it using different subsets of the training data right now both these options are obviously expensive.
