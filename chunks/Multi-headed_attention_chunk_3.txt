of eight matrices you have similarly you could have another's repeated block right and let me just show it on.
the next slide we just repeat these two blocks right and now you have head one head two and head.
one is giving you representations Z1 and this is giving you representations Z2 Now by several questions here right why.
would you have two heads and then if you are getting these two representations which one do you consider right.
so we'll answer those two questions but first let us motivate right why would you need multiple heads and we.
have already seen this in a different context before right so we want to motivate multi multiple heads in attention.
right so one head is uh one uh one one scale dot product unit which gives you Z one to.
Z T right the representation Z1 to Z T and I'm making a case for many such heads and so.
why why is why am I doing this right so we've already seen this in the context of convolutional neural.
