because there's just so much to learn that it cannot hold over fit possibly on all of this of course.
modern deep neural networks will still over fit but it's found that doing this kind of data augmentation which comes.
for free it's not additional cost for you then why not just try it and you would be able to.
get uh a lesser chance of overfitting in this case right that's all there is to this technique there's nothing.
more to be said here the only intuition here is that you have more training data you have more variants.
of the same image and all of that you have to be able to classify as two so now this.
chance of just memorizing and not understanding reduces a bit right that's all that happens and this works well for.
image classification object recognition it has already also been tried well for speech now it has also been tried for.
text there are libraries which allow you to do data augmentations but in text it's still a bit harder to.
