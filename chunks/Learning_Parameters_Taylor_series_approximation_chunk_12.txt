W minus W naught is the same as x 1 minus X naught right so that's what it's saying that.
now you can find y1 by assuming that this is a linear function okay and then you know the slope.
because you can compute the derivative at that point and now I can get a new value for y I.
can get the value for y1 where y1 is the value of the function at the point X1 and there.
is a small Delta between X1 minus X naught that means x 1 lies in the neighborhood of X naught.
okay and it will soon become clear why this is important okay so everything that needs to be explained has.
not been explained on the slide yet I still have some visuals on the next two slides which will make.
things more clear right but let's just go ahead with what we have now right let's just try to understand.
what it means to have a linear approximation you're just drawing a line at that point right and you're saying.
that if I just move along this line right so instead of moving along this curve which is what you.
