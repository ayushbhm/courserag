linear representation of what the protein looks like but that's not the reality right these amino acids they actually interact.
with each other and based on these interactions the protein starts taking certain shapes and it actually has this 3d.
structure right now knowing this 3d structure is important because if you know this 3d structure then it helps in.
drug design because if you develop a structure which is compatible with this 3d structure then it would lead to.
effective drug delivery for example and a lot of you could relate to this in terms of this covet pandemic.
right so we heard that this virus has this spike protein right which has a certain crown like shape and.
because of that it is able to attach on certain things well it's a similar analogy here that you have.
a certain structure a 3d structure it has a certain shape if you know what that shape is then you.
