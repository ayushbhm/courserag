right so I want I so in the next layer the the a neuron in the next layer depends on.
the uh H neuron in this layer so that's a i plus 1 okay and there are K of those.
so I'll sum over M to 1 to K and then the derivative of that with respect to h i.
j right and I'm confidently doing this because just on the previous lecture or the previous video I have actually.
shown you how to compute the derivative of the loss function with respect to A3 so I already have this.
quantity right so I am happy that this quantity is in the path because that quantity I have already computed.
okay so let's go ahead so as I just said uh this quantity I have already computed in the previous.
video right you can see that we had computed the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to every.
neuron in the uh output layer right a31 a32 all the way up to A3 K so this quantity I.
have already computed right here 3 is equal to I plus 1 and these are the m so this I.
