again do the computation and then again compute some other say green boxes right and now I have two representations.
for every word same movie I have one representation computed from the forward Direction and another representation computed from the.
backward Direction and I could just simply concatenate the those two representations to get the final representation of the word.
movie right and the reason I'm doing this or reason I am Computing this one step at a time is.
because I am interested in the context of the sentence right I want a contextual representation for the word movie.
so that's why I was doing this one step at a time to get the contextual representations for every word.
in the input right so which is also aware about what is happening in the words around it so this.
is important it's a contextual representation is important what is not good is in the interest of doing this contextual.
