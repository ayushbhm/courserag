can see that the loss is rapidly changing so now if I ever to aggressively shrink W2 that even for.
small shrinks in W2 my loss will go increase right and that is not not acceptable to me because I.
want to shrink it but I also want to maintain this trade-off that this law should also be small I.
want my W's to be small but I also want this loss to be small hence I have ended up.
with this trade-off that the weights which are more significant right which is W1 in this case I am shrinking.
it less because if I shrink it a bit more if I had brought it down to this value then.
my loss would have been even higher right and that is not something that I want right whereas when I'm.
shrinking W1 I have more leeway because along this axis my loss is less sensitive to changes in W because.
by a small change in W my loss is also decreasing slowly that's what is you can indicated by the.
slope right so this Gap if you remember indicates the slope the slope here is smaller that means a small.
