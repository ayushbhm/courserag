0 and 2 positive points sitting at 0 0 and 1 1 right and now you can go home and.
practice this you can try to adjust these weights w1 w2 as much as you want right but you will.
not be able to draw a line such that the two positive points are on one side and so many.
of you will guess from the figure it's not possible that you cannot have a line such that only the.
positive points are on one side and only the negative points are on the other side you cannot draw such.
a line so it's clear from the figure it's actually clear from the inequalities the set of inequalities that you.
see there right so this is not going to be possible so this is an example of a function a.
simple boolean function which is not linearly separable right now the reason we're talking about uh not linearly separable functions.
because most real world data is going to be not linearly separable right so here suppose you have two classes.
