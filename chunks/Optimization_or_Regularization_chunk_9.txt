so these are the weights or these are the regions where the weights are better able to capture capture the.
characteristics of the input data why am I saying that because where did you start with you started with this.
unsupervised objective you said that forget about my main loss function which depends on y first for every layer I.
want to solve this unsupervised objective the moment you do that for every layer you are putting the weights in.
certain region of the parameter space where this objective is getting minimized right so they are this is the entire.
say weight space now you have gone to some region there where this weights this objective is getting minimized once.
you have minimized this Omega Theta then you are throwing in L Theta right but you are starting from the.
weight initialization here itself now this entire space is not available to you at all right and now once you.
