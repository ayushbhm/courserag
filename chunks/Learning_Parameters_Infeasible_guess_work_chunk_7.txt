i would want the output to be close to 0.9 right this is what i expect to be and this.
is what i've written here right so if i plug in f of 0.5 then it should be as close.
to 0.2 right tending to 0.2 and f of 2.5 should be as close to 0.9 right now let's try.
to relate this algebra to the geometry right so now geometrically i know that i am looking for a sigmoid.
function which is a s-shaped function right now algebraically what i am telling you is that when i plug in.
these values they should be as close to 0.2 and as close to 0.9 so now can you tell me.
what is the geometric interpretation of that i'm going to get some function because this actually defines a sigmoid function.
right and now i'm found on w and b so i'm going to plug in those values right and then.
i can draw that function so what should that function look like or what should be a characteristic of that.
function of course it will be a sigmoid function of course it will have s shaped but there is respect.
