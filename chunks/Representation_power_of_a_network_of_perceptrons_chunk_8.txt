each perceptron in the middle layer fires only for a specific input let's see why that happens right so as.
i said the red weights are minus 1 minus 1 okay now if the input is minus 1 minus 1.
remember that 0 is minus 1 here so these are the 4 inputs that are possible minus 1 1 1.
minus 1 and 1 1. these are the four inputs that fire now if the input is minus 1 minus.
1 what will happen minus 1 into minus 1 will be 1 minus 1 into minus 1 will be 1..
so the sum will be two so the weighted sum would be greater than equal to zero minus two plus.
two hence this perceptron will fire okay and now i will show that this perceptron will not fire for any.
of the other three inputs right if this is the input then you have minus 1 into minus 1 which.
is 1 1 into minus 1 which is minus 1 so 1 minus 1 will become 0 and plus the.
bias will become minus 2 which is less than 0 so this perceptron will not fire similarly you can see.
