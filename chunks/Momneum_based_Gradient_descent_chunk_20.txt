a line it's still a sigmoid function it's just that it's a very uh gentle slope sigmoid function so it's.
going to go like this and at this point it's going to go like this okay but let's focus on.
the uh movement again so let's see now you can see clearly that momentum based gradient descent is moving much.
faster right but then it's also oscillating a lot right so it kind of went uh let me now just.
minimize this it's better to do it yeah so this is what it looks like and yeah so the momentum.
base gradient descent it was clear from the speed it was going faster right but then what was happening is.
that it was often overshooting right so it went here it should have gone here but it just went here.
then it took a U-turn and again took a U-turn then again took a U-turn right so you can see.
that uh you can play the video again and you can see that it's taking quite a few u-turns before.
it reaches its goal and this is exactly the analogy very good if it's on a scooter or a bike.
