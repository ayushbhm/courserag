the difference between the predicted value and the true function value right but we do not know the true function.
value so we cannot estimate this quantity and now we have written it as a sum of three terms of.
which I just showed you how to compute the first one empirically right so now you could compute it empirically.
from the data but there are two cases you can either use the test data to compute this or to.
estimate this quantity or you could use the training data right so let us look at both the cases so.
first we look at the case when we are looking at the test data okay so now suppose I look.
at the test data then this is the true error that I am interested in now the first quantity here.
I'm going to replace it by the empirical estimate that I just showed on the previous slide which is the.
average computed from the m test points that you had and the test points were the points from n plus.
