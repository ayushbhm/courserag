foreign [Music] so now we are going to talk about train error versus test error so let's see ah so.
now consider a new point x comma Y which has not been seen during training and so what I mean.
by that that this is where I was kind of ending in the last video so you are given some.
training data and based on that you have estimated F hat X right and now consider some new points right.
and one such point x comma Y which was not there in the training data right and now ah you.
want to see what is the error that this model makes on this unseen Point why unseen because it was.
not seen during training right so that's what the setup is so if you use the model f at X.
to predict the value of y then the mean square error is given by this quantity right so this is.
the expected error and why do we have an expected expectation means like roughly average or mean so what is.
it that what is it that we are taking the average on so again the situation was I had certain.
