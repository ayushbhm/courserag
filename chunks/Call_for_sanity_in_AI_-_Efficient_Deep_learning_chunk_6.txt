that incident right this clever hands tool kit was designed to again look at similar problems uh why do you.
get the answers uh right uh instead of just saying that oh i have got the answer right right so.
this toolkit allows uh machine learning systems uh to be tested on adversarial examples right so i showed you a.
few examples of examples on the previous slide where some stickers were added to the sign or some random patterns.
