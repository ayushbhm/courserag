idea of slope and that's why I wanted this other view here so if you look at this right here.
here the slope is very Steep and here the slope is gentle right so now if I look at the.
distance between these two rings horrible so if I look at the distance between these two rings right so let.
me just delete things yeah now what I was saying is that if I look at the difference between distance.
between these two rings okay and now imagine I am looking for the top then here the slope is gentle.
whereas here the slope is steep so wherever the slope is gentle the distance between the two rings would be.
large whereas whether the slope is steep the distance between the two rings would be small right so this the.
idea of steep and gentle slope was very important for uh the discussion that we were doing right we needed.
to know in which regions was the slope Steep and in which regions was the gentle and now the contour.
