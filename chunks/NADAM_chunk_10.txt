that you have here is beta M naught and I already had this at the previous iteration right so why.
am I doing this in the next iteration why am I coming up and Computing this in the next iteration.
here why am I doing it that's the question that we are trying to answer right so can we uh.
sorry I should have let me just go back sorry I Circle it the wrong so I'll start my expression.
again so when I'm Computing G1 I am doing this temporary computation which I don't want to do right and.
the what my argument is that at the previous time step I already had this beta m not right because.
that was already computed at the previous time step could I have done something at the previous time step and.
got an effective value of w which had already encompassed this beta I am not movement and then whatever w.
i get here I just compute the gradient of that right so I'm doing the liquid in advance and then.
sending it to the next time step that's the idea that we want to get to is it making sense.
