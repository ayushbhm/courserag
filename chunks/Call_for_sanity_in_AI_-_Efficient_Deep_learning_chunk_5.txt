here are a few advances in that direction right so there's now a workshop on human interpretability in machine learning.
which started in 2016. uh there's this clever hands uh toolkit which was developed right so so clever hands was.
this horse right and i think in the uh last century where um so so the horse had an owner.
and then he used to do the street show where uh where someone in the audience would ask it uh.
arithmetic question right what is 5 plus 2 right and the way the horse would answer is i think by.
nodding or by tapping its feet and it would kind of stop right so 5 plus two is seven so.
peop i mean during the shows it would do it seven times right and then people thought hey this horse.
is able to actually compute the answer and so on right but that was not the case what people later.
on realize is that everyone in the audience was giving it cues naturally they're cheering for it right so when.
