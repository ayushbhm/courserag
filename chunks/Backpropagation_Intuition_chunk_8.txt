strengthen it further right so this is what is happening right you had this network okay i gave you an.
example x as input you did all this computation because you had some current values of w b w 1.
w 2 w 3 b 1 b 2 b 3 these are not the final values these are not the.
final learned values you're somewhere in the training and based on your current understanding current values of w1 w2 w3.
you computed y-hat l not just that you computed some loss right after having y hat l you computed the.
loss function also and you got a non-zero loss so now you're trying to find out what went wrong i.
gave the network an x okay it produced a certain output i computed the loss based on that output and.
my loss is non-zero so who is responsible for this so this loss was sitting here so i will ask.
these guys first these are the dark green guys that i'll ask first right i'll ask them sorry hey you.
