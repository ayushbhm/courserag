a addition with a vector and all the dimensions here make sense right so a is equal to r a.
belongs to r n b also belongs to r n we just did that on the previous slide w belongs.
to r n cross n and i can multiply it with h i minus 1 h i minus 1 is.
h 0 in this case which is just the input and that also i had assumed belongs to r right.
so all this makes sense so this is just a simple matrix vector multiplication followed by an addition right so.
there's absolutely nothing uh fancy happening here right so just keep that in mind and that's how you compute a1.
that's all that's there's nothing more to it right so this is the pre-activation now what is the activation the.
activation takes the pre-activation right so this is and passes it through a function so what does that mean i.
have already computed a 1 1 a 1 2 a 1 3 okay and now i am going to pass.
this vector to a function right a 1 1 a 1 2 a 1 3 okay and now there are.
