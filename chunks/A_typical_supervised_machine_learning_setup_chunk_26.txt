function the way i want to right so the difference between y hat and y sum across all the training.
examples should be as small as possible right that's the same as saying that minimize this difference right so this.
is my loss function now okay and i want to minimize this okay and i could choose different ways of.
defining this distance or the d function right and i could choose the squared error loss for example so what.
is this saying that this is my loss function which is i look at all the training examples i look.
at the difference between y hat and y and i take the square of the difference why do we take.
the square of the difference so that the positive errors don't cancel the negative errors right so now suppose i.
wanted the value to be 1 okay and it predicted it as 0.5 then my error is minus 0.5 okay.
yeah this was y hat this was y so y hat minus y is minus 0.5 but there was another.
