your derivatives as you keep going down it keeps increasing in magnitude right I mean remember that you are increasing.
on the negative side which is fine its magnitude is increasing and then at some point because here I'm going.
to take the square that's why I'm talking about the magnitude right and then when it comes close to the.
Minima it again starts decreasing in magnitude and then it comes to zero right and that's because the loss surface.
was like that right so this is how the history is getting accumulated this is how the derivatives are changing.
and this is what is happening the red curve tells you what is happening to the effective learning rate as.
your history is accumulating the learning rate keeps decreasing exponentially right so if uh either to just plot let's just.
see this is what the learning rate curve looks like right I'm the same plot I've plotted separately so the.
red curve I plotted in a new plot so that I can have more range on the y-axis so the.
