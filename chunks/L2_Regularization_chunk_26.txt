it's still that's something that we need to understand but this is what is happening here from a linear algebra.
perspective right so w style first gets rotated by Q transpose to give Q transpose W star however if Alpha.
is equal to 0 right if Alpha was 0 then this just becomes this whole thing here just becomes I.
right if Alpha is equal to 0 and then Q transpose rotated W star then Q rotated it back in.
its original position and we got uh Q right because q and Q transpose are inverses of each other hence.
uh because Q is a orthogonal matrix so there was no effect of alpha is zero again just saying this.
for the sake of showing that whatever we are doing is sounding correct right ah but if Alpha is not.
equal to 0 then what is happening is the question right then what does D look like so first D.
has two components so first component is this so let us look at what that component looks like right ah.
by this I mean the whole of it right so first Lambda plus Alpha I so you have so you.
