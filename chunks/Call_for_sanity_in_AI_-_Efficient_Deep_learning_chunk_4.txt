uh that has deep learning is the current popular paradigm and delivering good results in various fields right so now.
while there are no clear answers yet but slowly and steadily there is an increasing emphasis on explainability it's not.
just good that you tell me your model gives me a good accuracy you also need to tell me why.
i am getting this accuracy right so that then i have a better grasp of these kind of issues that.
why is it seeing a speed limit fortify just because i put some stickers here and there right so these.
these uh things are uh coming into focus and a lot of research is happening on uh the theoretical justifications.
for why deep learning works why the uh research on explainability of these models how do you explain the performance.
of a deep learning model and so on right and hopefully all of this will bring some sanity right so.
here are a few advances in that direction right so there's now a workshop on human interpretability in machine learning.
