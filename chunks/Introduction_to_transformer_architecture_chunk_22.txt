right it cannot be paralyzed across T's but for a given T it can be parallelized and this is something.
that we would like to exploit and see that if we can get rid of this recurrent connection right because.
this recurring connection is still a problem for us right because because of the recurrent connection we have to do.
things sequentially but if we could get rid of the recurrent connections and then rely on the fact that the.
alphas can still be computed in parallel then can we get to an architecture which allows us to compute these.
Alphas in parallel right so it's still a bit hard to visualize where we are headed but just keep these.
questions in mind along the way and once we read there all these questions and the answers will make sense.
so just to summarize the discussion so far right so I mean everything about the RNA model is good right.
so what do I mean by that uh we saw that across papers right I mean we saw the architecture.
