these quantities is just going to be the inverse of that quantity now D is actually this further multiplied by.
Lambda right so this is what D is so now let me again try to multiply it by Lambda yeah.
so this is what I'll get right so I had this Matrix and now I am multiplying that Matrix but.
another diagonal matrix and it has lambdas on the diagonal so if you do this multiplication you will just get.
the product of these diagonal elements on the product Matrix right so that's all you will get okay so this.
is what this middle guy here looks like okay and if Alpha was 0 then the middle guy would just.
become I or this would all disappear so we'll just get I and there is no change happening W tilde.
is equal to W star but now if Alpha is not equal to 0 then what exactly is helping Happening.
Here Right foreign transpose W Star right so this is the first multiplication that is happening now each element of.
