likelihood of the correct class right so that's what it means okay because you are going to minimize minus of.
log of y hat l i will do this on the next slide anyways so we are minimizing the minus.
of log of y hat l right that is the same as maximizing the negative of that which is the.
same as maximizing the log likelihood right okay so you are minimizing the negative log likelihood which is the same.
as maximizing the log likelihood and obvious statement so this is what the loss function and the output function looks.
like for the classification class right but now one question here this y hat l is it a function of.
all these parameters because if it's not a function of these parameters then how what am i doing here right.
is it a function of all these parameters of course it's a function of all these parameters so remember that.
y hat l is this computed like this right so you have the input x it passes through these series.
