you'll again get a five and two dimensional output then you do an appropriate linear transformation you could choose this.
one so that your final z's are also five and two Dimension right so that's what you could do right.
so this is what a two-headed attention would look like and I've already told you how to extend it to.
multi heads you will just have the same block repeated as many times as you want and then finally you.
would just adjust all these Transformations right so as I said I could uh let's just look at it again.
if my edges are five and two dimensional these are H's then I pass them through I multiply them by.
a 64 cross 5 and 2 Matrix so I get 64 dimensional outputs here 64 dimensional outputs here same happens.
in all the eight heads so when I concatenate them I get a five and two dimensional output right so.
whatever I started with I get the same so I can just adjust the parameters accordingly and then I do.
