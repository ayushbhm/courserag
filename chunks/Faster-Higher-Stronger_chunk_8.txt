you want to do some kind of video classification at the end so it's important that every sequence interacts with.
the other sequence so that it understands what is happening in the entire sequence as a whole so rick canadian.
neural network allows us to do that it was it entered natural language processing in around 2013 or 14 but.
this idea has been there much before that right and there were two different types of neural recurrent neural networks.
which were popular well the question of course is that if they were proposed in 1990 and if it made.
sense for sequences and people were interested in a lot of nlp and speech at that time both nlp and.
speech have sequence of words and sequence of phonemes and why were these networks not being used again the same.
challenge a lot of work around that time which showed that it's very hard to train these networks in particular.
