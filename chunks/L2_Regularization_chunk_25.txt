else is 0 and if multiply the vector by such a matrix then it's the same as taking every entry.
of the vector and scaling it by the corresponding diagonal element so there are n diagonal elements and N entries.
in the vector so this multiplication the result that you get is simply uh every entry of the product is.
actually this corresponding entry multiplied or scaled by the corresponding diagonal element right so that's what is going to happen.
here and so on right so that's what the diagonal multiplication looks like so first you rotated it then you.
scaled it by D and then again whatever you got so let's call that Z1 right so this was my.
z uh now I got a Z1 and again I'm taking Z and rotating it by Q again right so.
that that's what I'm doing here so this I've made this observation now what does this mean and so on.
it's still that's something that we need to understand but this is what is happening here from a linear algebra.
