that we can even though even if there are boolean functions which are not linearly separable which a single perceptron.
cannot handle we can have a network of perceptrons which can handle that how to make this network a bit.
more compact is a question for later but now we know that we can handle with a network of perceptrons.
so again while we have proved this why do we care about boolean functions right so let's try to relate.
this to a real-world example the same example of predicting movies right so this is how the example plays out.
that you have certain features as you call it so these were is actor matt damon is the genre thriller.
is the director christopher nolan and so on okay all these factors and these are the labels that you are.
given and these are all your past movie examples there are some examples which i'm yeah there are some examples.
which i am calling the positive examples because their label was one and some examples which i am calling the.
