point to another i'm just getting lucky somewhere and i once i hit this point 0.94 minus 0.94 then i.
get a sense of what is required i need to increase the w's and decrease the b's and then i.
continued that way and then i went finally reach to the point 1.78 comma minus 2.27 where my error was.
close to zero and you can see that the sigmoid function is in the way it should be and you.
can see on the error surface also i am in that low error region in fact the error is actually.
zero right so that's that's what i was doing i was actually uh uh subconsciously or like without really knowing.
it actually navigating the error surface but i was navigating it randomly which is problematic because then i went down.
then suddenly i came up then again went down came up and i want to avoid that i want to.
have a more principled way of navigating this error surface right so that's what my quest is and that is.
what we will do in the next module okay.
