then there's nothing to do but we don't know f so what we do is we approximate f using F.
hat and then we estimate the F hat the parameters of f hat using uh the training data which is.
going to be a subset of this capital D right so I am going to refer to the training data.
as T and it's going to be a subset of the D which I have defined earlier and ah Y.
is going to be F hat of X now right so that is the approximation that we have made instead.
of Y is equal to F X Plus Epsilon which was a true relation and we did not know F.
we have come up with some approximation F hat and we have freedom in choosing what F hat we want.
to choose from like a family of functions and we could have different parameters for that right so we are.
interested in knowing ah the expected value of F hat x minus f of x the whole square right so.
this is the mean square error ah indeed so here expectation stands for the mean this is the error this.
