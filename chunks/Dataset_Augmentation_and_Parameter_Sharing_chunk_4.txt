text there are libraries which allow you to do data augmentations but in text it's still a bit harder to.
come up with very meaningful augmentations uh the main difference is in image and speech you have like continuous signals.
whereas in text you have discrete uh you have just words whether the speech you have a continuous signal similarly.
in image you have these pixels and so on so that's the main uh difference but even for text nowadays.
there are certain annotation techniques available right so that's all to be said about data set augmentation the next technique.
is about parameter sharing and tying and we will see this a bit more detail when we talk about ah.
convolutional neural networks so in convolutional neural networks you have if you want to process an image you do what.
is you use what is known as a convolutional filter and the same filter is applied to different parts of.
the image right so what I'm trying to show you here and this is of course become much more clear.
