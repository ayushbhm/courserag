about oh but maybe you have not considered all the x's i would argue by saying okay consider all the.
x's if you have forgotten to consider the parent salary okay put it in you might say that it would.
depend on the parent salary you would say that you depend on the children's education okay put all of that.
in right and construct as comprehensive and x as you can and then i would say that the y depends.
on this x so y is a function of x so that is known that y is a function of.
x but what is not known is what is this function so now what do you do in this situation.
right so you want to now your goal is to come up with this function so that for new x's.
so for a new location which i say the shell company has hired you and said okay this is the.
location i'm considering can you tell me what is the oil that i could mine from there so you want.
to plug in that here and tell the company that this is what the quantity of oil i estimate right.
