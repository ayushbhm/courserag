this is how this quantity is defined it's the average difference of the predictions from the two values for all.
the training points right so that's a clear notation right now suppose i was given only two training points okay.
these are the two training points given to me these are the x's and these are the y's so this.
is one x one comma y one pair and this is the other x2 comma y2 pair i'm just given.
two training examples okay and these are the values also right i mean these are actual points on the graph.
so i can see that one point is 0.5 comma 0.2 right so this is the point 0.5 comma 0.2.
as you can see and the other point is 2.5 comma 0.9 right so these are the points which are.
given to me okay this is my input training data and using this data i want to learn w and.
b and that's the setup that i have okay now um what is happening yeah so at the end of.
training we've we expect to find the optimal values of w and p right what are the optimal values though.
