now I have not explained what this function is I have not given you the formula for the perceptron I.
have given you a formula that Y is equal to 1 if something Y is equal to zero something I.
have not given your formula but for now we'll just appreciate that this looks more realistic right that it's not.
suddenly changing its decision it's gradually moving from zero to one right it's not like query uh sharp as was.
in the case of the earlier function right so to get this kind of an effect we'll now introduce what.
is known as the sigmoid neuron and sigma 8 function the function Sigma is like a family of functions and.
here's one member from that family which is called the logistic function later on in the course we'll see the.
tan H function which is also a member of Islam right and let's see what is happening here so this.
is this is a quantity which is familiar to us right this is the weighted sum of the inputs and.
