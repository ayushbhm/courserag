it's also going to have his self inputs right which is the inputs of the words that have been decoded.
so far right so it'll have these two types of inputs and let's see how it deals with these two.
types of right so so what would be the output Dimension right so let's first look at that too so.
we know what the inputs are now we look at the output so the output and what do I need.
to generate at the output again this is not new to you we have already seen this in the context.
of rnns so each output here would tell you a probability distribution over the vocabulary right and you will take.
the arc Max from there right so you would want that if there are 37 000 words so that's what.
the number 37 000 is then you'll get the probability of each of these 37 000 tokens and hopefully uh.
at the first position uh this should have been go actually right so let's assume there is a go input.
here and this is the first position so you hope that at the first position Nan has the maximum uh.
