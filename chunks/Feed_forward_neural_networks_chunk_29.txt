and then take the average so that's what your loss function is and you want to minimize this loss function.
that means you want to learn the parameters theta which is all of these such that this equation or this.
expression gets minimized or this quantity l theta gets minimized right so i'm going to call this as l of.
theta this quantity gets minimized so you want to find theta which is a collection of all these parameters such.
that this quantity gets minimized so this deep learning still fits in the paradigm of machine learning that we had.
these five components which we had data model parameters algorithm objective function and we'll have to come up with objective.
functions which will help in guiding the training uh criteria i mean guiding the training right so so we'll end.
this module here and then we'll come back and talk a bit more about output functions and loss functions.
