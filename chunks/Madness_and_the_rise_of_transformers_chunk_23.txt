it a text it is able to generate an appropriate image corresponding to that text right and dali was a.
transformer based model it was not a diffusion based model and now dalit 2 has come which is a diffusion.
based model and it has exceeded i would say expectations as i said it is very recent 2022 and improvements.
on top of that which is the stable diffusion model and a few other computing models are are quite the.
rage now right people are coming up with these prompts and feeding them these to these models and trying to.
generate very realistic images there's an astronaut riding a horse in a photorealistic style right i mean this of course.
this image perhaps wouldn't exist anywhere right but the but the model is able to imagine and generate these kind.
of image so it's quite exciting times for what are known as generative models and we won't cover uh in.
this first part of the course right i may do a subsequent course but in the first course unfortunately we.
