can see that all of these are quite different right so you have something which is going like this you.
have something which is going like this you have something which is going like this and so on right so.
all these functions which I am getting and these functions are plotted by ah substituting values for the following equation.
right so whatever I solve whatever Minima I get that will give me the value of the parameters I just.
plug in those parameters and plot it and every time I use a different sample of 400 my my uh.
the the the function which I get is different right it's quite all these I'm getting a lot of variety.
here a lot of variance here as opposed to in the simple model right so that's the observation that we.
are making so simple models do not differ from each other but they are far from the true sinusoidal curve.
right they should have been very close to the red curve but I mean the moment I chose a simple.
