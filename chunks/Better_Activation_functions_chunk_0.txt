foreign [Music] so this is where we were when we left off yesterday we were talking about how deep learning.
has evolved and there are these four axes that we were considering and we have already talked in detail about.
the first two and today we'll start a discussion on better activation functions right so that's where we are so.
with that let me just go to the next module uh yeah so so before we look at these activation.
functions right so let's try to uh first motivate why do we need to talk about activation functions and the.
motivation comes if we try to introspect this question what makes deep neural Nets powerful right and we already saw.
this uh briefly when we were talking about the universal not briefly actually quite in detail when we are talking.
about the universal approximation theorems I just want to revisit that and emphasize on uh some a component of the.
deep neural network which is important in granting it its power right so let's see what that is so now.
