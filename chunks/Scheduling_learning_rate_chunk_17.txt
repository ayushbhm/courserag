log of 4 right and that would be 2 so this will become 2 raised to minus 3 which would.
be 0.125 and then this would become 0.875 so as you can see you are slowly increasing the momentum uh.
term the beta term right which is the amount that you should give to the history right beta tells you.
how much weight is to give to the history so as you are training is progressing you are planning to.
rely more and more on the history and less on the current update and that makes sense right because now.
if you're close to the Minima and then one faulty update will take you away from the Minima right but.
whereas if your history is uh pointing in a certain direction you would like to rely on that because over.
the large number of updates you have reached in this region so you want to give more weightage to your.
history as opposed to the current update so what this is doing is as your training progresses your beta value.
