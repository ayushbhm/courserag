for that input right and if this data was linearly separable then I should have a network such that it.
takes any input from this training data and it gives me the same output as is given to me in.
the training date right in the training data I'm given these X comma y pairs right and then I have.
a network I pass this x through the network and it predicts a y I'll just call it y hat.
so I wanted the Y hat and the Y to be same and that's what it means by this network.
can exactly represent the function right now I'm just losing that definition a bit I am saying that can I.
have a network which can approximately represent the function right which means what that I want y hat to be.
approximately equal to y y this approximately y naught exact we'll come to that later all right for now if.
you want to assume I want something which is exactly equal that's also fine right but I'm just going to.
