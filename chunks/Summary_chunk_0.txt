foreign [Music] so one thing that people have shown right is and particular this paper which uses skip connections as.
a regularizer and I'll talk about that in a bit that the effect of regularization is to smoothen the Lost.
landscape right so typical uh and you can go on to this website right which allows you to explore typical.
lost Landscapes that you encounter in neural networks and you can see that this is very bumpy right it's not.
nowhere closer to the very nice loss functions that we have been dealing with which have like a single plateau.
and then a valley and so on it there are like multiple plateaus rallies here and there are some very.
sharp slopes here right and what happens is that if you have flat surfaces right and let me show you.
a plot it will become clear right so if you have a flat surface you will get better regularization why.
why is that the case because if you have a flat surface then for a large range you have the.
