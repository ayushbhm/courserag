close to zero right so remember initially they'll increase because I'm going down the slope and the slope is increasing.
so the derivatives will increase and I'm showing it this way because they are increasing in the negative direction right.
so the slope here is negative uh so this is what the curve is like so here the slope at.
this point it's negative right because you're going down as you are going down or as you are moving in.
the X Direction the value of y is decreasing right or as so that's why the slope is going to.
be negative so it's going to increase in the negative Direction then again it's going to start decreasing and then.
it will come to zero right and that's exactly what is happening in the derivative plot that we just saw.
now let me go back to the plot yeah so this is what is happening right so initially uh here.
your derivatives as you keep going down it keeps increasing in magnitude right I mean remember that you are increasing.
