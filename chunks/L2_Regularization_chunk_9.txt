long ish I would say a derivation right we'll just try to uh go a bit deeper uh into what.
the Taylor series says and from there what do we derive and so on right so let's assume that W.
star okay is the optimum yeah so let's assume that WSI is the optimum solution for LW so LW remember.
was our unregularized loss function right so our new loss function is uh L tilde W is equal to LW.
plus this Alpha by 2 into W transpose W so this LW as well as was our unregularized loss function.
so let's assume that the optimal solution for that was given by some W star the sum W star which.
exists which gave me the lowest value for l w right so that's all we are defining right and there's.
no problem with that definition foreign now consider a point which is ah say a point w which is in.
the neighborhood of w Star right so the way to write that would be W is equal W is equal.
to W Star Plus U so there's a point w which is in the neighborhood of w star the other.
