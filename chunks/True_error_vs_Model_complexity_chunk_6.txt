are missing out on things right you are not really ah giving a true picture of the true error right.
so this was the quantity that was bothering us and now this quantity again I could think of it uh.
of about am of estimating it empirically right so what do I mean by that I could again think of.
this as summation I equal to 1 to ah M or n Epsilon i f hat of x i minus.
f of x i I can think of estimating this quantity empirically okay this is just a comment right just.
an observation now why this I'm making this point is that uh there's this Lemma called Steins Lemma we can.
show that uh yeah this should have been sorry n because we had n training samples and this should have.
been average so what we can show that this quantity which is the empirical estimate of the expectation is actually.
equal to this quantity ok now this is a joke that I have every year with my students you don't.
ask me what Stein's Lemma is and I will not ask you what Stein's Lemma is but we just for.
