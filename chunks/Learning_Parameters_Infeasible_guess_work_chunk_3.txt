to predict the imdb rating on a scale of zero to one right so it could take values like zero.
point zero five point one point two whatever right it could take any of these values so it's a real.
input a real output right so that's it's easier for me to explain a few things in this setup but.
it does not change anything that i'm going to talk about even if you had boolean inputs we'll see later.
on how to adjust the same explanation to boolean inputs but for now i'll assume we have a real output.
right sorry not input output so we have a real valued output okay so that's the setup that i'm going.
to work with right and now the first thing is that i need some training data right so i've been.
given some training data so as i said that there are capital n pairs of now this is a good.
notation capital n for the number of training pairs and small n for the number of inputs that i have.
the small n is equal to 1 in this case right so this is the training data that i have.
