then it will just be a sum of all those right so this is uh the derivative of uh the.
loss function with respect to W when there was only one one point right so in that case LW itself.
was uh just f of x minus y the whole square right but now if I have many points then.
I'll have a summation here and I'll Index this by I I'll Index this also by I right so I.
have a summation so I have told you the derivative for one term in this summation if there are such.
n terms in the summation then the the derivative will also get added up right so the derivative of a.
sum is just the sum of the derivatives right so that's what is happening here so I have just taken.
the sum now so if there are two points I'll have this the sum here so I have this right.
now similarly you can compute the derivative of B and you can see that all of this is same the.
only thing extra here is this x i and that is coming from the fact that you had W X.
