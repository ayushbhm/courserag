I've done is uh I have changed one of these data points only one of the data points right I.
have instead of taking X comma y I have taken this x comma y right and now you can see.
that my simple model has not changed much right so my f hat of x so I changed y but.
my f hat of X did not change much that means this quantity is going to be small right but.
for the complex model my my estimation has changed quite a bit right so now when I changed a y.
by a small quantity my f hat X has also changed dramatically right in this region it's very different uh.
from what it was originally right so hence for complex models small changes in the training data could cause a.
large change in the estimated function right the F at X or the estimated values of the parameters right so.
that is just a empirical demonstration or an anecdotal demonstration of this idea that complex models are more sensitive to.
