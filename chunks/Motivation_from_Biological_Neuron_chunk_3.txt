a very cartoonish illustration of how this uh works and how a neuron works right so our uh sense organs.
they interact with uh the outside world right so we see we hear and so on so now let's assume.
you're watching some uh a cartoon or if you're watching some uh comedy uh movie or serial right and let's.
in this case it's uh you're watching something from sheldon and then your eyes are seeing it your ears are.
hearing it let me just get rid of this so they then relay information to the neurons here i am.
just showing a single neuron on the next slide i will show you that it's not just one neuron but.
a network of neurons but let's just go with this right so the neuron receives signals from the sensory organs.
it processes it and then it might decide to take an action right so in this case if the neuron.
is excited enough if this is really something very comical then it might uh get activated and in turn signal.
