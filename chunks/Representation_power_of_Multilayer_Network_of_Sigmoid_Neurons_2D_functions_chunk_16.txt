is sitting here on the top of the structure this is the tower that i'm interested in but i have.
these some extra scaffoldings here and there which i want to get rid of right so now how do i.
get rid of that right so now if i look at this entire structure right i'll just get rid of.
the annotations and also get rid of the individual h11 and h12 yeah yeah so this is what my structure.
looks like and you can see that at the bottom while it's open yeah the structure sitting at the top.
is closed from all sides so this structure sitting at the top is closed from all sides right now there.
are three levels of output here there's a zero level okay which is here then there is a level one.
and then there's a level two right and i only want to retain things which are greater than one right.
so that if i only retain things which are greater than one suppose i could have a way of filtering.
