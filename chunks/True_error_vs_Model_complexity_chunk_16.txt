to n sorry I keep changing M and M but I assure you understand what I mean this is what.
L train is and what I was trying to do is I was just trying to minimize this but now.
I've realized that if I try to minimize this and make it to zero there's this another quantity which is.
dependent on the model complexity which keeps increasing so in effect my expected error is increasing right so I might.
have done a great job of reducing this to zero but the cost of increasing this significantly and then the.
net effect is as my model is still bad when I am going to pass it test instances which were.
not seen during training this expectation is going to be this error is going to be still very high right.
so that's why you should not try to just minimize the train error but train error plus the model complexity.
is what you should try to minimize now how do you encode this model complexity drive just Define a generic.
