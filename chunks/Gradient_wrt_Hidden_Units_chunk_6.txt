and there are multiple paths how many parts are there there are K Parts here right because from s to.
2 you go to a31 okay and from a31 you can go to the loss a32 you go to the.
loss because the loss depends on a31 a32 all the way up to A3 K all of this the loss.
depends on and all of these in turn depend on H22 so there are K parts from H22 to the.
loss function so if I want to compute the derivative of the loss function with respect to H22 I'll have.
to sum across these K paths right so in my case the P of Z is the loss function my.
Z is equal to h i j I took a specific h 2 2 but it's in general h i.
j and my intermediate outputs are these alms right so al1 al2 Al 3 and so on those were my.
intermediate outputs right okay so with that let's try to see how to find the derivative so again we are.
interested actually we are interested in the derivative of the loss function or the gradient of the loss function with.
