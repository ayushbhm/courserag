should keep W comma B the point on the yeah on the W comma B plane right so this here.
is the W comma B plane so the W comma B plane I should keep moving till I reach this.
nice optimal value here at which the loss is minimum okay so let's see if I can run this so.
the algorithm is running it's initially quite slow you can see that the yellow dots are moving right it's slowly.
slowly moving it has finished some 27 iterations it's the loss is still a bit high it's 0.81 as you.
can see here and it's still running running running but it seems to be going in the right direction at.
no point am I seeing that the loss is increasing and it keeps going I'll Just Fall Down good the.
loss has decreased quite a bit and I'm very happy that I'm moving in the right direction again it has.
slowed down a bit why is it slowing down in certain regions why is it not going fast in other.
regions is something that we'll figure out but now it has started moving and you can see that the loss.
