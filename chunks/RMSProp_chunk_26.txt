the flat surface so then as we had said right the is history can then start decreasing right so this.
is the region where you had ah High gradients right this is the region where your gradients started decreasing right.
I mean this is till this point they were increasing and from here onwards they started decreasing and if you.
now look at this and compare it to the behavior of the learning rate in this uh let me just.
uh change the color yeah so in this region where your gradients were increasing the learning rate is steadily decreasing.
right and this is exactly what you want when the gradients are high you want the learning rate to decrease.
and now in this region once your gradient started becoming small the learning rate started increasing because your denominator which.
was accumulating the history over a period of time it starts decreasing because now all for the past many time.
