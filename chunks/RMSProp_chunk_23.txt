that I'm going to show you now and I'll tell you what all I'm going to show you in this.
animation right so this is VT oops yeah so this is VT which is the accumulation right so remember your.
I don't know how many times I have written this formula now yeah so this is VT the blue curve.
is going to be VT which is not coming yet this green curve is your initial ETA naught in my.
example it has been set to 0.6 so that's why the green line does not change across iterations and this.
is going to be your effective learning rate or I have not taken the square root here but it's going.
to be proportional to the effective learning rate right so now uh so far so good [Music] let's see what.
is happening as the iterations go along we are seeing some behavior of the plots right in uh before I.
comment on that I just want you to look at what is happening here right so you started off with.
