something that I like about this idea here right and we're going to take it further the other thing is.
that as I increase the number of towers which eventually will kind of connect back to increasing the number of.
neurons that you have I can get better and better approximation so that's where the idea that if you give.
me a particular Epsilon I'll be able to find a network we have not gone there yet right but if.
you give me a particular Epsilon you can see that at least in this in this pictorial illustration right I.
can get better and better right I can make the approximation as good and I've stopped the slider here but.
you can imagine there is still scope of reducing the width of the rectangles in which case my approximation will.
become even better and better right okay so I'll move ahead from here yeah more the number of such star.
functions better the approximation okay so now this is what has happened in the previous slide I had this I.
