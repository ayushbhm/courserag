but now when you start producing the first word right at that time you have T1 inputs right of which.
only one is valid because that's the go word and you know that okay go is the start signal that.
I get but all of these are junk right you don't know what these are right and now what are.
you going to uh do uh for each of these you are going to compute the q k and V.
vectors right so these are the capital T1 inputs given to you right and you're going to compute the q1.
K1 V1 right the QQ Matrix the uh the query Matrix the key Matrix and the value Matrix right but.
while doing that you are aware that whatever value you're getting for these guys right that does not make sense.
whatever key you are getting for these guys does not make sense whatever query you are getting for these guys.
this does not make sense because these are some junk inputs you don't even know right this might just be.
