to the loss plot and I'll make some comments there and then come back here yes yes and I'm on.
the access x-axis you have the number of iterations right yeah so if I look at the loss plot right.
and let me just clear this and then make some comments here yeah so remember we had started from here.
okay so initially the uh you are in a slightly it's t steep right from the beginning it's steep right.
but the steepness is increasing that means as I keep going down my derivatives will become larger and larger right.
in magnitude the direction may be positive or negative but the magnitude will keep increasing then when I enter this.
Valley region my derivatives will start becoming smaller again right until they reach a point where the derivatives will become.
close to zero right so remember initially they'll increase because I'm going down the slope and the slope is increasing.
