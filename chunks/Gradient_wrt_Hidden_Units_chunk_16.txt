computed right so that's all it says this is the same formula that I have here and again this is.
a not very difficult right so even if you didn't get it now you could just go back and take.
a look at the slides all the notations have been explained clearly if you understand the notations this is a.
straightforward leap from there right so whatever we had computed what did I what am I trying to say what's.
my summary I have computed the derivative of the loss function with respect to one of the Hidden units right.
I wanted to in fact not even this right just one the dark red guy right I actually wanted to.
compute the derivative with respect to entire H2 but I've just computed with one element of H2 right and that.
is this quantity it's the dot product between two vectors one of the vectors is the jth column right and.
J comes from here the jth column of the weight Matrix and the gradient Vector right the gradient Vector is.
