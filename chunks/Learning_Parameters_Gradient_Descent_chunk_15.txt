just the formula for the COS of the angle and this quantity which I was interested in luckily shows up.
in this formula hence I am interested in it right so this is what uh cos beta is and the.
good thing is that cos beta is bounded right so that means this quantity is also bounded okay good so.
if I multiply throughout by this the denominator that you have here I'm just calling it K so that I.
don't have to write this large quantity every time so this is what I get right so the quantity that.
I am interested in I know that it lies between minus K and K right and I don't care about.
uh the positive values of this quantity right I want this quality quantity to be less than 0 right so.
I just care about the negative side because I want my condition was that U transpose into this gradient should.
be less than 0 that's the condition that I have right so I am interested in the values which are.
