while there is a huge variance in them you can see that on average the gap between the True Value.
and the predicted value is much smaller if you look at on average across the entire x axis then if.
you plug in different values of X and if you have to compute the error for all the values of.
X it's much smaller here as compared to the simple model that's visually clear right I mean the complex model.
is at least able to give me a sinusoidal shape whereas the simple model was not even able to do.
that right okay so these are just observations that you are making and then we will try to formalize these.
observations right yeah so simple models very close to each other not much variance between them complex models they're far.
from each other that means there's High variance but simple models tend to underfit they are not even able to.
give me a zero error on the training data itself whereas complex models are able to overfit they are giving.
