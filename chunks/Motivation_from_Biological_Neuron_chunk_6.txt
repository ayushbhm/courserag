demonstrate uh this so i'll just first again illustrate with the cartoon and then go to a more real example.
is that you might have this neuron which fires only if the visual is funny there might be other neurons.
which fires only if the speech or the sound is funny right and another neuron which might fire if the.
text is funny that means whatever is being said is funny and then you might these three neurons might pass.
on the information to a fourth neuron and that neuron might fire if at least two of the three inputs.
are on right if two of the three inputs are activated then this is enough for it to fire and.
it in it turn would do some other action right it might just activate other neurons or might directly be.
responsible for taking some action right and here i'd like to demonstrate the visual cortex right of the brain right.
and it has many layers let me just delete this and then do it again yes so here you have.
