if x is less than or equal to 0 this is how I'm going to rewrite it on the next.
slide so main thing to note here is that both the activation functions the output depends on the sign of.
the input if the sign is positive then you get a certain output if the sign is negative then you.
get a certain output right and now I'm just going to rewrite the radioactivation function as I said on the.
previous slide I could think of it as 1 into x if x greater than 0 or 0 into x.
if x is less than equal to 0 right now uh the Dropout function also does the same right I.
mean the Dropout idea of Dropout is that you have a certain number of neurons and if you apply the.
mask then you could think of this mask as the activation function which either zeros out the neuron or lets.
it pass through right and then apply some activation function on top of that right so it also does the.
same the only difference is that instead of one and zero it has this stochastic uh uh nature right so.
