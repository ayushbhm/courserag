perhaps we don't need to do anything right so remember the momentum equations that we had where we had u.
t is equal to Beta U T minus 1 plus Delta WT now in and when we had expanded out.
those equations that you can go back and check those videos uh we had so we had written it as.
u0 is equal to uh Delta W 0 U1 is equal to Beta times Delta W 0 plus Delta W.
1 then U2 is equal to Beta Square Times Delta W 0 plus beta times Delta W1 plus Delta W.
2 and so on right and this entire thing is essentially captured by this formula and so you can go.
back and look at those videos but now I've in fact already explained it here itself so you know what.
what I am talking about okay we now have in Adam we have a slight modification that we have uh.
beta1 and then 1 minus beta here right so here we only had the beta term we only had the.
beta term here but in atom we have beta and then this is also 1 minus beta right so we.
