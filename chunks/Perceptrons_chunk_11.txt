get clear over a series of lectures right so this is something that we would like to learn and now.
this model has these placeholders for weights which could potentially be learned right and these weights could be such that.
what do we want right we want the weighted sum to be greater than some threshold right or the weighted.
sum including the threshold to be greater than equal to 0 that's what we want right so now you could.
imagine that there's an input signal which is weak but the weight for that input signal is so high that.
collectively it crosses the border right and so it's possible that you only have one input which is on right.
which is the director is nolan and all the other inputs are off but the weight of this input might.
be very high based on your data because you have always liked movies directed by christopher nolan so you would.
have a very high weight for this and because the weight is high even though there's only one input which.
