had difficulties in training a deep neural network so I've ignored that problem I've said okay I'll worry about that.
later right now let me just focus on this right so if I am able to train this entire network.
what does that mean that this layer is producing good outputs this layer is producing good outputs this layer is.
producing good outputs and this layer is good in producing good outputs and finally the final output is good right.
so this entire problem was becoming difficult for me I was not able to train the entire network so I'm.
saying let me just focus on one layer now and for this layer what is the definition of good that.
it should capture all the characteristics of the input that is how I have defined goodness and I have designed.
this objective function accordingly and I've reduced the problem to training a network containing just one hidden layer so input.
hidden and output and this is a shallow Network and shallow Network training was not a challenge right so I.
