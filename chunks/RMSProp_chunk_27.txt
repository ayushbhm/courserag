was accumulating the history over a period of time it starts decreasing because now all for the past many time.
steps your history has been smaller gradients so all the high weightage things of R of small values and the.
initial High values of gradients are now have diminished because they are being multiplied by a very high power of.
beta right so as the VT starts decreasing the learning state starts increasing right so just to repeat till this.
point your gradients were high hence your history was increasing after this point the current gradients were very small and.
hence your history started decreasing because now all all you're in a steep region so all the things that are.
getting added from this point onwards they're all small all so your effective sum is decreasing and in these two.
halves you see the right behavior of the learning rate initially it decreases and then it increases when the curve.
