look at one point and I'm just making an approximation that the average is as good as one point right.
whatever estimates I make from one point are actually as good as the average that I'll get from a million.
points so that's of course a bad approximation but you do that and while it seems bad we'll see under.
what what you could do to not make it so look so bad right foreign so now if you have.
a million data points we'll make a million updates in each Epoch what is one Epoch Epoch is the outer.
loop right when you are making updates so far uh every Epoch you are going over the entire data and.
for every data point you're making an update so if there are million data points then in one Epoch you're.
making one million updates right so one Epoch is one pass over the entire data and one step is equal.
to one update right now what's the flip side now we have gone into bad territory right you know what.
