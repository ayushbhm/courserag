vectors and then you have uh two linear Transformations happening so this is the first linear transformation which is at.
here and then here's the second linear transformation that is happening right uh and then you have this one non-linearity.
in the form of the tannage right uh and then what you have is that that internal non-linearity multiplied by.
those two linear Transformations their entire equation gives you one vector and then you're taking a DOT product between that.
vector and your V right so just to summarize there are three vectors two linear Transformations one nonlinearity and then.
finally a DOT product right so the final answer that you get right if I were to simplify this what.
you get at the end is just the dot product between two vectors this Vector in turn was computed using.
two other vectors which in turn had gone through a linear transformation right so that is what is happening here.
