green ai talk about having sanity in what we are doing just not put out models but also try to.
explain why they work and so on so i didn't want to end on that somber note so i'll again.
talk about some exciting times right so the ai revolution is now uh driving scientific research also and let me.
tell you what i mean by that this is the uh protein folding uh uh problem right and deep mine.
in 2020 released a model for predicting the protein structure of sorry the the three structure of proteins right so.
what do i mean by that right so we uh every protein right is made up of a sequence of.
amino acids bonded together right and we know these amino acids this sequence for all the proteins that are there.
in the body right but now this is just like a i would say a illustrative representation or just a.
linear representation of what the protein looks like but that's not the reality right these amino acids they actually interact.
