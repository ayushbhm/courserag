it's saying is that as W increases L seems to increase right so that's that's okay whatever this function is.
I don't care about it but this is how the function looks like okay now Suppose there is a point.
uh W naught okay at which I know the loss okay and where is this coming from how does this.
relate to our original R uh uh our goal right which is to find uh a new value of uh.
W says that the loss is less right so that will soon get related but for now I'll give you.
some intuition right so Suppose there was only one parameter and I timed step 0 I started with the value.
W naught and I could compute the loss I don't know the full loss surface but I could compute the.
loss right now I'm looking to change this value W naught right and I want to decide whether to go.
here or here so that my loss decreases that's what the goal is and we'll relate all of this discussion.
to that goal uh soon right in the figure it's clear that I should move to the left because there.
