pass it through some output function and that is going to give me uh the output y hat which is.
shown as the dark or the shaded green part here right so what should my output function be right so.
now let me ask you a question it can it be the logistic function right so we had seen the.
logistic function which takes any input right so a3 would be the input and i am asking whether o can.
be the logistic function right and what would that mean it would just take the input and it would compute.
the logistic function for that right now can that uh is is that okay is the question right so it.
just should be it will compute it element wise eight so a three one a three two a three three.
is what it will compute and that would be y hat one y hat two y hat three right because.
the three values that i'm trying to predict so is that a good choice right and as all of you.
realize it wouldn't be a good choice because the logistic function i know is going to clamp all my outputs.
