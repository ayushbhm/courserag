from a different lens of how the research and development output has increased in ai in the past few years.
okay now again coming back to uh the technology side of things right so we talked about uh convolutional neural.
networks recurrent neural networks and so on becoming very popular and solve becoming these state of the art de facto.
models for speech and nlp right around this time while this was happening right ah in a very short span.
of time while we were seeing all this success uh there came what is known as transformers and which is.
again revolutionize the field of ai most models that you see today are transformer-based models so that's what we are.
going to talk about now and you'll again go back in time and talk about machine translation so transformers are.
first introduced in the context of nlp and machine translation so we'll go back to machine translation where the first.
