i complicating it by adding parameters different different weightages to different features okay but something more fundamental than that right.
let me okay so this doing this is akin to saying that y is equal to 3x plus 2. i.
have fixed my parameters right here i'm just saying that the parameter is 1 right what is the problem with.
this i'm not learning this i just said okay y is equal to 3x plus 2 i just cooked it.
up now who tells me whether 3 and 2 are the right values i have to learn that from the.
data right so if i don't have any parameters i have nothing to learn i just told you y hat.
is equal to 1 plus e raised to minus x now throw away all the data that you have for.
any new x that you get just plug in here and you'll get the value and live with whatever value.
and that's not what you want to do right you want to have certain parameters so that those parameters can.
be learned right so what would happen in the sigmoid case for example right this is what a sigmoid function.
