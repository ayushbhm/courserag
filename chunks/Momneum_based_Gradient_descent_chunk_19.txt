here it will roll down it will not stop here it'll go up then again come back go up then.
again come back and it will keep oscillating it so let's see if this effect is what we see in.
the momentum based gradient descent algorithms oh my God so now you see gradient descent is moving very slow but.
it's decidedly going towards its goal okay I'll have to play this video a few times so this gradient isn't.
just slowly converging now you can see that it's found the configuration where both the points lie on the sigmoid.
function right so this is actually a sigmoid function like this right so I'm just showing you a slice so.
it's a sigmoid function like this and I'm just showing you this portion of the sigm point functions it's not.
a line it's still a sigmoid function it's just that it's a very uh gentle slope sigmoid function so it's.
going to go like this and at this point it's going to go like this okay but let's focus on.
