that so this is what happens if I plot that without the bias correction right so what happens is that.
I get you can see that my black curve now is a bit farther away from the red curve at.
least during the initial time steps right and yesterday also we had seen that during initial times test we have.
a problem when we use bias correction so why does that happen let's try to understand that so so our.
formula is beta into Mt minus 1 plus 1 minus beta into the current time step value right so that's.
it the Delta w t right now at time step 0 my Delta w t was around 1 right but.
my Beta is 0.999 and this is 1 minus beta so this is going to be 0.001 right and my.
m t minus 1 is 0 because I initialize at like so m t minus 1 since T is equal.
to 0 this is going to be M minus 1 and that I have initialized to 0 right so this.
whole sum moves towards zero it becomes very small and then the same thing keeps repeating right because in the.
