right and uh I'll repeat the intuition which I always give for this right so uh this would be relevant.
to the audience here at IIT Madras so now suppose you're standing at the velachery gate right and you're asking.
instructions you ask the uh some person there about how do I go to Phoenix Market City Mall right and.
that person would say that you take a right uh from the gate and you will reach the ball right.
so now you have asked someone but you are a bit conservative so you take a small step towards in.
that direction you take small small steps and say after say 10 steps or 20 steps or say about 100.
steps you ask someone else hey where is uh the mall and that person again says yeah go in this.
direction right go towards the right so now your confidence would increase right because now repeatedly you are being told.
to go in that direction someone said go to the right again someone said go to the right so now.
