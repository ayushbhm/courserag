why would the neurons get saturated right so let's try to understand that why is it that it would get.
saturated and it's not given right because the function can take values between 0 to 1. so why is it.
that it would suddenly become one or suddenly become zero right so let's let's try to answer that so this.
if I were to consider any such neuron in the network right so suppose this is one of the neurons.
this is not the output neuron but say some neuron in the network and this is what the output of.
this neuron would be right it would be the sigmoid of the linear combination of the inputs connected to it.
right so this is what the output would be now suppose I have initialized the weights to a very high.
value right suppose my weights are say suppose 100 200 and so on and now my inputs are all standardized.
it'll be anyway standardize the inputs that means we divide by the subtract the mean and then divide by the.
