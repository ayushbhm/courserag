to the input you multiplied it by the w1 weight and added the b1 vector what did you get here.
you got a one right you got this output okay then what did you do you passed that through a.
non-linear function g and that function was simple in the sense that it was just operating on every element of.
a1 and then from here you got sorry oops i okay so this was a one this gave you h1.
once you had h1 that became the input for the next layer what did you do with that you again.
multiplied it by w2 right and then you added b2 and that gave you a2 then you passed it through.
this non-linearity and you got not g2 sorry h2 right then h2 became the input for the next layer so.
you multiplied it by w3 and then you added b3 and that gave you a3 and then you passed it.
through a spatial output function to get h 3 which is the same as y hat which is the same.
as f hat of x right so you have actually written the output as a function of the input it.
