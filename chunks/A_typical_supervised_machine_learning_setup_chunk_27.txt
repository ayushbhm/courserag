wanted the value to be 1 okay and it predicted it as 0.5 then my error is minus 0.5 okay.
yeah this was y hat this was y so y hat minus y is minus 0.5 but there was another.
example where i wanted y and y hat was predicted as 1.5 so now my difference would be 0.5 plus.
0.5 so if i just take the sum of the differences then this minus 0.5 will cancel this 0.5 and.
it will look like i have zero error whereas actually i have made two errors and two horrible errors right.
both by off by 0.5 so the moment you square it that sign disappears right so you could take the.
square and the other you could have argued that why not just take the norm right it's just the absolute.
value right but the problem with the absolute value is that it's not a smooth differentiable function whereas a square.
function is a smooth differentiable function and we want uh smooth differentiable functions because later on the hero of the.
