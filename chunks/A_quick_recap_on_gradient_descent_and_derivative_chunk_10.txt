infeasible the guesswork can lead you to uh false Direction so when I was guessed trying to guess the values.
are W and B at some points I was making a guess such that my loss was actually more than.
what it was at my previous case so that doesn't work and this is the brute force method which also.
doesn't work right you cannot do this Brute Force search when you have a large number of parameters even for.
two parameters we cannot do right so you want something which is better than the uh Brute Force as well.
as the uh guesswork algorithm and now I just shown you the visualization for the guesswork algorithm right so what.
I was doing is that as I keep picking values from this table here uh my loss changes and what.
happens is actually I'm moving on this lost surface right so this yellow Point keeps changing depending on my current.
wnb and subconsciously I was actually moving on this lost surface without actually knowing what the loss surface was that's.
