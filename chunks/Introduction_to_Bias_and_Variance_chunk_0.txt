foreign [Music] so welcome to lecture six of the course and in this lecture we'll be talking about regularization right.
and different types of regularization ah which includes L2 regulation early topic and a bunch of other things but before.
I talk about the types of regularization that you use in the context of deep learning of course some of.
them are also in the context of machine learning I'll first tell you give you intuition for why we need.
regularization and that's where we'll focus on the discussion on the bias various trade-off right so that's where we'll start.
we'll make a case for regularization understand what regularization is and then look at different types of regularization okay so.
here are some acknowledgments I have referred to several sources for preparing the this lecture this includes a deep learning.
book Ali goat sees video lectures and regularization in the context of deep learning then this paper on dropout right.
