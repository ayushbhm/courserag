separable of course it is not and we had said that a single perceptron cannot deal with this data right.
or cannot deal with linearly separable not linearly separable data but what do i mean by cannot deal right what.
would happen if i apply perceptron algorithm suppose i blindly go and say okay i want to just apply the.
perceptron algorithm here what would it do can you tell me what would happen in this case it'll make errors.
for some points what's the point of a perceptron algorithm the idea of a perceptron algorithm is that you'll find.
some separation boundary right now we know that if the data is not linearly separable this it will not converge.
right because we'll keep toggling some points will be here and there but if i just do okay i'll just.
do it for some thousand iterations for a fixed k i'll do it so what do you expect would happen.
at the end it could draw some line right now there many lines possible you could draw this draw this.
