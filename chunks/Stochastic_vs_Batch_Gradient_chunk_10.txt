point ten point or 100 points as long as you're not using all the data points you are in trouble.
right because you are not really doing a true estimate of the gradient but you have to make this trade.
off between what is true which is all the multimedial points taken together versus what is approximate and let's see.
what happens when you do this approximate right so uh now what I'm going to do is I'm going to.
run stochastic gradient descent and gradient descent on this loss surface and we'll make some observations about it yeah so.
the green guy is gradient descent and the black guy is stochastic gradient descent and as you can see in.
the black guy there are a few oscillations whereas the green guy is going finer it's smoothly going down whereas.
the black guy is often getting off course and then coming back right and the reason that is happening is.
because you are not making a true estimate of the gradient you're just making like a approximation or a stochastic.
