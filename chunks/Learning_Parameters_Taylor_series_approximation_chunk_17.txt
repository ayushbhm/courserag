Blue Line but as the neighborhood increases if you come go very far from the point that you were and.
now you're going to try it so this is your X naught right this this point here is your X.
naught right and let me consider some x one here right so now what is sorry this should have been.
X1 so now what it is telling me is that if I try to compute y1 is equal to Y.
naught right so this point here on the line is y naught okay if I try to compute y1 is.
equal to Y naught plus the formula that I had at M into X1 minus X naught right then the.
answer that I'll get is this and you can see that it's way off right it's not not really a.
good approximation even if uh my X1 I was here right and then what I'll get if I substitute in.
this formula I'll get the y1 as this point and you can see that it's actually very far off from.
the true value of y1 right so hence this as the neighborhood goes this approximation becomes bad so that is.
