so it's a bit messy uh I I couldn't find a better way of explaining this if you have suggestions.
I'm open to using them but the main idea here is this the takeaway is this that you add the.
nestrov factor into the atom equations which means you do a look ahead and to make this look ahead a.
bit less Messier in terms of writing and making sure that most of your equations are same as atom and.
you just push your head into the last look ahead into the last equation uh we did that rewriting of.
Nag and we just explained that instead of doing something at T minus 1 then t and t plus 1.
we had everything in terms of t and t plus one so the look ahead was already done before I.
went to the next iteration hence I did not need to do a look ahead again in the next iteration.
right and once you understand that then this equation is just the just a manifestation of that and the all.
the one minus beta beta terms that you see here now let me just clear the all the annotations these.
