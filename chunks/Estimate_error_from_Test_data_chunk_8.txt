is the expected value of Z so our random variable here is z and it can take any value 0.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 maybe as many goals as you can score and you are interested in.
the expected value right now expectation as you define in probability of course is you have to have repeat this.
a large number of times but you only have like some K matches that you have seen the way you.
compute the estimate or you empirically estimate the expectation is by using this formula right this is something that we.
have been doing for ages right I mean in in our studies in high school engineering and so on where.
we just compute we are given a set of samples and we compute the average as using this formula and.
that average is actually the empirical estimate of the expectation right and the analogy to our our derivation where we.
were stuck would be the following that I am interested in the expected value of the square error between y.
