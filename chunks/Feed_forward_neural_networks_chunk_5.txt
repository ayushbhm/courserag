it it need not be like all of these are n that's just for convenience i've taken it this could.
be n1 this could be n2 and this could be n3 and so on that could be different the value.
of n could be different across layers is what i mean but for introducing the concepts i'm just going to.
take n it does not have any bearing on the concepts that we learn it's without loss of generality it.
could be any n right or my explanation holds for any value of n so it's just for convenience that.
i'm keeping it as n throughout okay finally there is an output layer containing k neurons right so you have.
these l minus 1 so that is 2 and then the third layer is going to be the output layer.
in this example so i have a total of l layers in this case l is equal to three and.
n minus one hidden layers and one output layer right now each neuron in the hidden layer and the output.
layer i'm going to split it into two parts right so what are these two parts uh i'll let the.
