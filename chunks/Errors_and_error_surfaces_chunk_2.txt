example where it's clear that it's not always correct to say lies above the line right because these are all.
points which are lying above the line but they are actually in the negative half space so above and below.
does not really Define negative and positive half space it simply boils down to equation the inequality right so minus.
1 minus ah x 2 minus sorry let me just erase this and write it properly yeah so this is.
the equation of the line so all the points which satisfy this greater than equal to 0 lie in the.
positive half space and this happen to be those points or the points in this region and all the points.
which satisfy the inequality less than 0 are in the negative half space and it so happens that this entire.
red region is those points right so it's not above or below it's about ah whether greater than equal to.
zero or less than equal to zero which of these inequalities is satisfied okay so these these points line the.
