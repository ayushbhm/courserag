toy example aside right the simple thing is this right so I'm asking you to go from place a to.
place B but I am saying that hey certain types of turns are not allowed if you're not allowed to.
take certain times of turns and you are restricted only to some types of turns then you are going to.
take more time right so that's the main idea and that is happening because sigmoids are not zero centered hence.
we get all values as positive hence this negative positive combination is not possible in the uh directions that you.
choose to move in right and lastly of course sigmoids are computationally expensive because you have the exponent to compute.
because there are faster ways of computing it but still it's a computation that you need to do right so.
that's the other reason so that is all about the sigmoid neurons and why they are not the most convenient.
activation function so then ah because of these limitations right so at some point uh so now because of these.
