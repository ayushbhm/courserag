2 so beta raised to 3 minus 2 which is the same as beta and then you will have the.
Delta W 2 here so this is how the formula has been arrived at so in general for the tth.
time step I am now ready to write the formula the formula would just be 1 minus beta of factor.
of 1 minus beta being common right and then beta raised to T minus Tau Delta W2 and it's very.
similar to this formula except that you had this 1 minus beta term which has shown up on this formula.
also right so nothing great here don't to worry too much if you have not understood this right away you.
can go back and look at the steps and you can derive this formula on your own right so I've.
derived the formula for Mt and this is important for the rest of the discussion that we'll have okay so.
now let's look at okay now let's take the expectation on both sides that I have empty on one side.
and I have uh the Delta WT quantity on the other side so I'm going to take expectation on both.
