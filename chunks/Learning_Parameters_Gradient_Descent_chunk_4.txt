I'll get the gradient vector and the gradient Vector is a two dimensional Vector in this case right so that's.
what this quantity is you have the loss function Theta and you are taking the gradient of theta of the.
loss function with respect to Theta and we know that Theta is nothing but W comma B and this Theta.
is also W comma B so this is just a vectorial way of writing it that you're taking the partial.
derivatives with respect to W and B you put those partial derivatives in a vector that Vector is called the.
gradient and this is the quantity that we are using to denote that gradient and now it makes sense because.
you're taking the gradient of a function which is a function of a vector with respect to that Vector right.
that's what that's how you should read right so this is what this quantity is right now for this discussion.
I think I can stop here because this is where I am going to draw a line I am going.
