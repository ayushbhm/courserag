the neighborhood of w Star right so the way to write that would be W is equal W is equal.
to W Star Plus U so there's a point w which is in the neighborhood of w star the other.
way of saying that is that let's consider a jump such that you have W minus W Star right so.
uh you could think of it this way this is more natural that we are looking at a point w.
which is in the neighborhood of w star and from that equation you can derive this equation right so that's.
that's the small jump that you have made okay now let's let's we'll now do a bit of reasoning or.
a bit of derivation starting from there right and now let's see what the Taylor series says this is Taylor.
series second order approximation so far in this course we have been dealing only with the first error approximation but.
now I'm talking about second order approximation and what this says is that the loss function in this neighborhood right.
