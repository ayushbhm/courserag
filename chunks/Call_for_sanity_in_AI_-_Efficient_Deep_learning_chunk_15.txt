is also another axis around which we need to talk about being responsible right so i was talking about the.
human brain right so it has 10 is to 15 synapses but it only consumes 15 watts of power right.
whereas if you look at these current deep learning models i showed you one model which was trained on 2048.
tpus which is a huge amount of power and compute right and in the period from 2012 to 2018 there.
has been a 300 000 folds increase in the amount of uh compute compute that is being used for training.
these models and this has been doubling every few months right and you can see uh in the in the.
shaded portion here right that in the past few years there's a rapid increase in the size of these models.
or the uh computes that you're using uh for training these models right and that that has to stop right.
because you are being irresponsible in some sense and this should give it make it clear so if you have.
