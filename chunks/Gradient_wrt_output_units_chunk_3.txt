i am trying to do i am trying to take the derivative of the loss function which has the term.
y hat l with respect to one of the y i's okay and we know that this log y hat.
l depends only on one of the elements in this array the one which corresponds to the true loss function.
right so in particular let's take an example suppose l is equal to 2 that means the second class was.
the correct class then the loss function would in effect be minus log hat y2 and now i have trying.
to take the derivatives of this with respect to any one of these right because i have considered a generic.
i here right so this is an i so any one of those elements so if i'm trying to compute.
with respect to y1 hat of course the loss would be zero right because this quantity does not depend on.
y one hat there is no y one hat that shows up here if i try to compute with y.
two hat then it would be minus 1 over y2 hat because that's the derivative of so if you want.
