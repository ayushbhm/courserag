V2 would be V2 would be 0.999 into V naught plus 0.01 into 0 square and that would give me.
this quantity okay and that is again a reasonably High Learning array right so what we are seeing is that.
uh in the absence of bias correction this is not bias corrected I just took VT I did not take.
VT hat right please note that so in the absence of bias correction as the paper says uh your initial.
steps could be very large because your initial learning rate would be very high but now if I had done.
bias correction okay and I had the same situation my w naught was 0.1 so now V naught is this.
the bias collected value is 0.01 okay and now if I substitute this bias corrected value in ETA my effective.
learning rate is 10 as opposed to 316 here right similarly V2 gives me a certain value if I bias.
corrected it I get certain value and now my learning rate is 13.8 as opposed to 316 here right so.
