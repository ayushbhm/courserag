to be so let's just run the perceptron algorithm right so what will i do what does the algorithm do.
it picks up a point randomly from the union of p comma n right so let's say i randomly picked.
up a point and the point was p1 okay and my condition is not satisfied so w x w transpose.
x or the dot product between w and x is less than 0 right whereas i want it to be.
greater than equal to 0 so i'll have to apply a correction right so now i'm going to apply the.
correction w is equal to w plus x where x is nothing but the point p 1 okay so if.
i apply this correction let's see what happens so you can see that my w has changed right and you.
can see the as i was expecting the new angle between w and p1 is now less than the older.
angle right so this greedy step has worked in doing whatever it was said to do right so it has.
reduced the angle now let me do it again right so now again randomly pick a point and say this.
