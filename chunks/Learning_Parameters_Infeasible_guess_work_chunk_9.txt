what we are looking for it so this connects uh i would say the math to the geometry right so.
the algebra to the geometry that uh when you plug in these values you get some output and this is.
what it would mean geometrically right okay so now let us see this in more detail right so as usual.
i never know what the w's and b's are right i've given these two points i'm going to start with.
some random w's and b's so here i have started with uh if you can't see it let me just.
see if it's on the file ah so w equal to three and b is equal to minus one 1..
that's what i have started with okay and now this is the sigmoid function that we get i know that.
intuitively i know that this is not correct why is this not correct both the points are not on the.
function right this point is also not on the function right so both the points are not on the function.
and just on the previous slide we saw that when the network is trained or when i have learned the.
