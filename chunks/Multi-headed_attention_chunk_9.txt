computation and then participate in the loss so if it helps that now this set of Alphas should be such.
that it should focus more on the word animal and if the loss dictates that then the machine would learn.
that or the model would learn that right so that we're not giving it an explicit signal we're just hoping.
that by Trying to minimize the loss it has more freedom now in some cases it can learn to put.
a high alpha here in some cases it can put a learn to put a high alpha here right so.
you're making a better design Choice by allowing it more uh choices right or allowing it more parameters in terms.
of the W's the projection matrices which in turn result in different Alphas right so just making it a more.
flexible model which has more choices or more options to how to adjust the alpha in different cases so it.
might choose to have Alpha was high for one case Alpha animal high in the other case and then do.
