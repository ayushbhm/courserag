look at uh we we are also plotting now the VT and the UT right so uh because they are.
delayed by one time step their curvature would be the same right they would have the same shape so both.
of them have the same shape but their magnitudes are different right because of this delay one is relying on.
more on the past history like one more time step from the past history whereas the other one is relying.
more on the current history so what is happening is that when you are entering this uh uh let's see.
so what is happening is in this curve so what happened was initially you were in a high loss region.
right or a high loss region but also relatively flatter region right here the difference between the Constable contour lines.
is higher than what happens as you keep going down towards the valley right so that means initially your gradients.
were small right so the guy who is going to be behind which is U T minus 1 is going.
