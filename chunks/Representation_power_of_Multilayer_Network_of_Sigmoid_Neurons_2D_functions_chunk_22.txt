where there's a true function x and let it be as arbitrary a function as you want right you can.
always come up with a neural network which will be able to approximate it to a desired degree of precision.
if you add enough neurons in that neural network right and that's the foundation right that's the reason why deep.
learning is so formula popular because it's saying that you could take a deep neural network which could approximate arbitrary.
functions and that's what we do in machine learning right you have an x you have an f of x.
and you want to come up with an approximation f hat of x and now you have found an f.
hat of x which is just what i showed you on the previous slide right which is a neural network.
that's the function it's just a composite function you took the input took some sigmoid took some out addition then.
again added it but it's all a function of x it's a composite function of x you could construct these.
