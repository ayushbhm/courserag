flatter in this direction right and now you can see b again just helps in movement along the direction right.
so i can change the point at which the crossover happens by changing b so you can go back and.
play around with this figure and animation and try to understand how changing the values of w1 and w2 affect.
these uh this sigmoid function if i increase both something interesting happens right so you can just play with this.
right so the point is again clear if i set the w1 very high i could again get the step.
function and the orientation and all i can control and if i have b as i move b the step.
function will move right at the threshold at which the crossover happens right so again the same idea as in.
2d i can adjust the w's and b's to get something which looks like a step function right so now.
let's try to construct a tower in 3d okay now i didn't want to show you this okay right so.
