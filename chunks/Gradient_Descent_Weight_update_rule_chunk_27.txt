algorithm I have shown you the Mac behind it I have shown you the visual interpretation of that and I've.
also shown you how to code it and then run it so that you move on the loss function in.
a principle way right so I'll uh end this video here before just telling you quickly where do we head.
from here right so now the next thing to do we have done this completed this cycle that we introduced.
sigmoid neuron just as we had introduced perceptron then we introduce the learning algorithm just as we had introduced The.
perceptron Learning algorithm then we discussed the error and we ran the algorithms in both cases in perceptron as well.
as in the sigmoid neuron and we saw that the learning algorithm actually learns well and it keeps moving in.
the right direction so all of that we have seen then in the perceptron case we had moved on to.
the representation of the power of the perceptron perceptron and now we want to talk about the representation power of.
