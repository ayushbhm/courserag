saw right so this is this is the model complexity term that we had seen and now you have to.
come up with some functions which act as an approximation of this and when you are trying to reduce this.
it actually decreases the model complexity which means it will decrease this quantity which means it will decrease this sum.
right so you should come up with omegas which decrease the model complexity because if the model complexity decreases this.
term will decrease and hence this term will also decrease right so that's the way you are going to handle.
this complex term here because directly handling it make looks difficult but you could Define some omega thetas such that.
you are sure that if you minimize that Omega Theta your model complexity is going to be reduced and hence.
you will be sure that this term that was bothering you is going to be reduced right so this actually.
