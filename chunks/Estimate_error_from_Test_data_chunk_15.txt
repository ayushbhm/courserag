how to deal with the third one is still not clear right because it again has f of x so.
we need to see if we can somehow get rid of this third quantity or make some comment on that.
right so that part is still remaining so let us look at the third part and make some observations about.
it so ah remember that Epsilon here what is Epsilon actually so Y is equal to f of x plus.
Epsilon so Epsilon is actually ah y minus f of x right ah so now you are trying to find.
the covariance right so this quantity as I said is the covariance so between Epsilon and this ah other random.
variable and I just told you that Epsilon is actually equal to Y minus f of x side we just.
saw that that simply comes from the fact that Y is equal to f of x plus Epsilon now the.
statement that I am going to make is that this y minus f of x is actually independent of f.
hat x minus f of x why am I saying that because when I am talking about the Y's here.
