then again the blue or the purple wall and then again the cyan wall right so it's it's you have.
a tower sitting somewhere inside that so now let me look at the sum of these two functions right so.
now i have what i've shown you is h11 minus h12 and h13 minus h14 one of them is the.
purple colored structure and the other is the cyan colored structure now let me take a sum of these two.
and see what happens right this looks quite weird let's see why this is happening right so let's just try.
to explain that again so now it's very simple actually nothing much to explain the same argument that i had.
earlier so in this region both are 0 right so if i add them again you will get 0 right.
similarly in this region both are 0 if you add them you will get 0. similarly if i just maybe.
move it around yeah in this in this region again both are 0 so if you're going to add them.
you'll again get 0 and then let me just move all the way back again in this region both are.
