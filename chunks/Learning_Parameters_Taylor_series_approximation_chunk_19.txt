that happening because the slope in that region right is quite less so my Delta or my M right it's.
very less and that's helping right but now if I change the value of w a bit right if I.
go here now here my slope is very high as you can see right the gradient is very high and.
now in that case my approximation is becoming very bad right so this is what the same window I have.
not changed the window right but uh now if you can see this is the approximation and this is the.
true value and the Gap is very high right whereas with the same window if I'm in a region where.
the slope is small right then still the approximation is quite good you can see that the points on the.
Orange Line are very close to the points on the blue line because this is a region where the slope.
is very low right whereas this was the reason where the slope was very high right that's just some observation.
