capacity these are very large models and when you start do a basic course on machine learning you will the.
first thing that you learn is that hey if you have very complex models then they are susceptible to overfitting.
they'll completely learn the training data but they'll not perform well untested right but this is not what is happening.
for deep learning models right they are high capacity but they are still somehow being able to overcome this problem.
of overfitting right to a certain extent some cases they do overfit then there is this numerical instability i spoke.
about this vanishing exploding gradients and even gans and diffusion based models they are often hard to uh not diffusion-based.
models but at least gans are often very hard to train and get unstable during uh training right then they.
have this sharp minima right because this uh the uh the the loss function that you have in deep data.
