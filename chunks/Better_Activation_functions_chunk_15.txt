so what if it's not zero center right what could the possible what could the problem be right so now.
let us try to again see that through an example suppose I have this output layer and before that I.
have this one sigmoid neuron right and it is connected to two inputs h21 and H22 so I'll have the.
A3 would be this and then I'll passing it through the sigmoid neuron right now again if I were to.
update the weights W1 or W2 let's see what chain rule I will use there so this is what my.
derivative would be right so it would be derivative of the loss function which is sitting here with respect to.
Y right then the derivative of y with respect to H3 so the output is H3 then the derivative of.
H3 with respect to A3 right and then the uh oh sorry this and then the derivative of uh A3.
with respect to W1 which I have already written as h21 so this is what A3 is if I take.
the derivative of this with respect to W 1 this quantity disappears because it's a constant and the derivative of.
