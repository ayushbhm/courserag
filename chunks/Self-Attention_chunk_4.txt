showing it for the last word again so I'll take uh H Phi in this case pass it through WQ.
and I'll get my Q Phi similarly I'll get K Phi and similarly I'll get V5 right so if I.
had t words in the input I have computed this 3 into T vectors using these linear Transformations okay now.
what next what am I going to do next right so now what I want to do is I want.
to compute earlier I was Computing the score let me just flash the equation and then I can do it.
so earlier I was Computing the score between St minus 1 and HJ and this was used to give me.
the importance of the j8 word and the TX time step right so again now I'll have some score and.
my indices would be I and J right the ith word and the jth word but now what does go.
here that's the question right so let's see what goes here the function that I'm going to use is to.
compute the score between q1 and K J right so now my this is my query Vector so I'm interested.
