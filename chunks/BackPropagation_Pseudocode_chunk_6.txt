last rear which is W3 so this will be a from L uh going from L to 1 right so.
w 3 uh which will depend on the derivative of the loss function with respect to A3 and uh H2.
right so this you have already computed in the forward pass this you have already computed this is just computed.
outside the loop so you have all the elements that you require to compute this right similarly you can compute.
the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights in the layer three so this also you can.
do because you just need this quantity which you have already computed because K is equal to l right now.
we are running the loop from L to 1 okay so this is done now you compute the ingredients with.
respect to the layer below so now you can compute the derivative of the loss function with respect to K.
uh K minus 1 so you had started with k equal to l to 1 right so now at this.
point uh K is equal to l so K minus 1 would be L minus 1 so which would be.
