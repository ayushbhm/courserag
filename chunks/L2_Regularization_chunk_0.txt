foreign [Music] trade-off and from there we went on to this equation which involved the regularization term so what we.
said is that so far we were discussing about minimizing the training error which was computed as the average error.
over the M training examples and this was empirically computed as say the difference between the true value and the.
predicted value right and then we realized that if you minimize this you are not actually minimizing the true error.
because this is not a good approximation for the true error it does not account for this additional term which.
comes from model complexity and instead of just minimizing this it's possible that you might minimize this to zero but.
still your true error would be high because your model complexity is high right and hence instead of minimizing just.
a training error you should minimize training error plus some regularization term and this regularization terms should serve as a.
