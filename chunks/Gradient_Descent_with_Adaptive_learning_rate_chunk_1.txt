rate to be fast right so that's what I mean by adaptive so it should look at okay how is.
the history been and where am I currently and can I accordingly slow down or maybe speed up a bit.
right and the gradients will of course not change if you are in the Steep region they will be large.
and if you're in the general region they will be small right you can't do much with the gradients but.
then the multiplying factor which is the learning rate can you change that so that you can scale up and.
scale down the updates accordingly right so uh that's the idea that we want to explore in today's lecture right.
so let's first again make a case for it so here's again a simple neural network there's a slight change.
in notation which I had to do because now we have four inputs so it's not a change in notation.
just a new notation so we have these four inputs so far we have been dealing with a simple neural.
