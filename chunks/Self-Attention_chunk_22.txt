64 in the examples that I had done so there is uh some uh there's some justification for why you.
need to do that I'll not go into it uh but for all practical purposes you're taking the dot product.
and then just scaling it by some value right so this is what the dimensions look like as I had.
already explained uh so you get all the capital T outputs and since you're taking the dot product and then.
scaling it this is known as scaled dot product attention and this is how you should look at the series.
of operations happening here right so you had Q you had K and B you did a matrix multiplication to.
get Q transpose K when you did a scaling to get the scaled output then you did a soft Max.
on that and then whatever you got as soft Max which would have been a matrix right this soft Max.
of this entire thing this is again going to be a t cross T Matrix which is going to get.
multiplied by a t cross 64 Matrix and that's the mat mile that I'm talking about here and then finally.
