[Music] hi everyone uh welcome back uh today we'll uh start with feed forward neural networks and talk about the.
back propagation algorithm right so where are we so far in the course right so we started with mp neurons.
then we moved on to perceptrons we dived quite a bit deep into perceptrons where we spoke about the representation.
power of perceptrons that it's just a linear separator and it can only work for data which are linearly separable.
then we looked at the perceptron learning algorithm we also looked at why there's a guarantee that it will converge.
for linearly separable data right and then we moved on that okay this linear boundary or this threshold kind of.
a thing which we have in a perceptron that's that's not very convenient and in real world we take decisions.
which are much more smoother so we move to the sigmoid neuron right and then for a single sigmoid neuron.
