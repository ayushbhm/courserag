close to the expected value because ideally I would wanted the expected value because that would tell me over all.
the data points if I had taken all of them what would my gradient be right but I'm not able.
to take the expected value for because there are large number of data points right so what that means is.
instead of expected value of the derivative we are Computing empty as some kind of an average right so expectation.
you could think of expectation as the mean or the average but instead of computing the true expectation we are.
Computing some empty which is an exponentially moving average ideally we would want that the expected value of empty is.
the same as the expected value of the derivative itself of the gradient itself right this is what we would.
want ideally now let us see if that is really the case that is that happening if that's happening then.
perhaps we don't need to do anything right so remember the momentum equations that we had where we had u.
