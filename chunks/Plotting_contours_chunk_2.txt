vertical okay whatever reasons okay this is good yeah maybe this angle is good so at regular intervals along the.
Z axis I have taken slices right so these are the slices that I have taken at regular intervals along.
the z-axis and I've also labeled the intervals right so this is minus 0.8 this is the slice at minus.
0.6 minus 0.4 minus 0.2 and this is at -1 right so these are regular intervals because they are happening.
at intervals of 0.2 and similarly I keep doing so at every point two distance I have taken a slice.
now if I were to see this from the top okay and maybe I should delete yeah so if I.
were to um yeah so I've done these slices at regular intervals and I've also labeled the slices now if.
I were to look at it from the top this is what it would look like right and this is.
exactly what the contour map looks like which is drawn on the right hand side right so contour map is.
