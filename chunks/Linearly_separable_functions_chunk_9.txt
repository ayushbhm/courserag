separable right and if that is the case with the simple boolean functions and i said in real world we.
have more complex cases where the data will not be linearly separable right so we need to have a way.
of dealing with not linearly separable functions we need to have a way of dealing with them in the generic.
case when your inputs and outputs are not boolean at all but for now in this lecture at least try.
to see if you can have a solution for the case where your inputs and outputs are a boolean so.
that's what we'll do for now okay so i'll end this module here and in the next module we'll try.
to come up with a network of perceptrons which can handle boolean functions which are not linearly separable even though.
we know that a single perceptron cannot handle boolean functions which are not linearly.
