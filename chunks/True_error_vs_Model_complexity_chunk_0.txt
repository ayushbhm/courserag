foreign [Music] observations right so the case two was when you are going to estimate the so now we are.
looking at what happens if we look at the training observations right so again we are interested in this quantity.
we cannot estimate it because of this so we have approximated using these three terms and now the first term.
so now we look at the case when we try to estimate that expectation from the training data right so.
what do I mean by that again making things clear we are interested in this quantity I cannot estimate it.
because of this f of x here so I have expressed it as a sum of these three quantities and.
now the first quantity which was an expectation I am going to empirically estimate it using the training data so.
using the N training points okay that's what I have put here right so this is the empirical estimation of.
the error from the training data this is again a small constant and now we have this quantity here now.
