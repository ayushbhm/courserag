a very low loss whereas gradient descent was a very high loss right and 50 iterations corresponds to two seconds.
of the video there are 25 iterations per second here so I'll just play it quickly again one second it's.
already much ahead of gradient descent two seconds it's actually reached the Minima it's now just going to keep oscillating.
there but gradient descent is still very far and now despite these oscillations it's reached its answer whereas gradient descent.
is still trying to reach there reach there it's there still not there and now it is there right so.
you can see that momentum based gradient doesn't reach there much quicker than gradient descent despite these oscillations so what.
we would like to see next now is that can we the oscillations are a part of the life now.
right given that we are moving fast but can we do something to reduce these oscillations and that's the idea.
