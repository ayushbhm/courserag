the code for that right so to now to see this in action right we need to First create some.
data where one of the features is sparse right and I also remember that I can only show you a.
2d plot that means I can have one feature on the air one axis and another feature on the other.
axis so I'm just going to be able to work with two features one of them is going to be.
W and the other one is going to be B right and remember the feature b or the feature corresponding.
to B is dense because it's always on right the corresponding input is always one so I can't do much.
about that so what I'm going to do is that I am going to create a data where my X.
which corresponds to W is going to be very sparse right so that's how I'm going to create this data.
so let's see this is what I'm going to do so this is what I'm saying right the third bullet.
point here says that we just have two parameters W and B of these the input feature correspond to B.
