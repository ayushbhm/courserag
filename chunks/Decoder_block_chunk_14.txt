when you are doing so the key thing to realize here is that these did not participate in the computation.
right these gave you the uh corresponding q k and V but when it was time to use those V's.
you just zeroed out the waves right so irrespective of what your input was this did not participate in the.
computation similarly whatever you compute here will not participate in the rest of the computation because the corresponding Alphas would.
always be zeroed out you'll always use this masking right here also you will have a masking so only that.
part of the input which is currently being decoded is going to participate in the computations the rest of the.
input will get masked out because you will set the corresponding Alphas to zero right so that's what masking means.
so we are done with the first masked self-attention block here which is it's just going to use a only.
those many entries right one to h means the number of time steps which have been decoded so far instead.
