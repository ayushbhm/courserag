is zero because Epsilon is a zero mean noise so all those terms which contain A1 A2 are going to.
be disappearing why will they disappear because you are taking the expectation of a product and the two random variables.
in the product are independent so that expectation can be written as the product of expectations and in the individual.
terms are there now become zero so all these terms are going to be disappearing and so you will only.
be left with the uh with the quantities which contain the squares so those are these quantities right so w.
i square plus Epsilon I into Epsilon I square and you'll have n such terms so that's why you have.
n terms here right so that's that's a pretty long ah um yeah I mean long set of explanation for.
what how I went from here to here right and again I have said that this quantity also becomes zero.
so why does that quantity become zero so this is y hat minus y okay so here you are a.
