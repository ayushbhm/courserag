because I'm taking them greater than zero because it's a relu activation function so I want both of them to.
be uh active and not dead so say both of them are greater than zero but a two one is.
less than a to 2 right so what does that actually mean uh let's try to understand that in terms.
of how neurons react to training samples right so if a21 is actually uh less than a to 2 it.
means that 8 to 2 is reacting more positively to this training sample right it's firing for this training sample.
even better because its output is high right so now if it related to our earlier discussions on MP neurons.
and so on we had the situation that if the inputs are of a certain configuration then this neuron fires.
right now this neuron is firing More Than This neuron which is firing weakly right so now that means this.
neuron is more uh sensitive to this training data and maybe I should respect that right so when I'm updating.
