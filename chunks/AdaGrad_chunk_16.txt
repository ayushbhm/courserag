accumulations may happen only after a large number of iterations such that the denominator becomes large and then the effect.
of slowing down kicks in right but as opposed to this uh for a dense feature what would happen is.
you had the B feature which was a dense feature now this history is accumulating faster right because now the.
derivatives are going to be non-zero uh quite always right because this is like an always on feature so your.
history is accumulating fast uh it will not be zero for most of the time steps and therefore what will.
happen is uh VT will start growing rapidly and hence this will start decaying rapidly right so now effectively what.
will happen is this advantage that you had that you quickly move in the direction of B and came to.
where you want it to be that will not happen right because now this directions the in the increments in.
the vertical direction will happen a bit slowly as opposed to earlier where it was quickly moving in the vertical.
