training error is 0 I will not believe you because this quantity has not been accounted for and I know.
that higher the model complexity this value would be high that means more complex your model more farther away would.
your empirical estimate of the training error be from the true error right and just to make sure that this.
indeed happens that complex models are actually more sensitive to changes in the training data as opposed to simple models.
let's just take a look at that right let's just try to see that yeah so now what I have.
taken this is some training data that was given to me and I estimated the true model I estimated the.
complex model which is the red colored model and the simple model which was the green color model now what.
I've done is uh I have changed one of these data points only one of the data points right I.
have instead of taking X comma y I have taken this x comma y right and now you can see.
