this is L Theta now what are these other terms here right this ETA is fine right that's our small.
uh that multiplication will keep happening everywhere now this here is that seems to be the dot product uh between.
two quantities right now you I have already defined here right U is the change that we want to make.
so that's nothing much to explain there but what is this other quantity that you see here and let me.
just underline it with a different color so this quantity so we'll try to figure out what that quantity is.
so let me clear up the slide now what that is is the gradient right and that's where the name.
gradient descent comes from but let's try to understand what that gradient is right so now if you have a.
function right let's say x square okay I have y is equal to x square then I know that d.
y d x this is called the derivative all of you know this from high school which is 2x right.
