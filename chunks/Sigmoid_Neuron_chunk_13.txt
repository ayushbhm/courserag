had a movie well it's a Critic rating was 0.51 then my output would be like right and this is.
why I say that this is very harsh right this is not how you would take decisions in real life.
that 0.49 is not like but 0.51 is like there is a very little difference between in these two right.
when you wouldn't base your decisions like that what you're looking for is something more smoother than this right which.
calibrates that okay 0.49 is uh good 0.5 minus slightly better right it should have that calibration right so that.
is missing it's just very harsh that and I'll show you a figure on the next slide which will make.
this very clear right and that's the point I want to make that is not a characteristic of the problem.
that you have chosen it's not that about movie ratings or it's not about the way I have chosen this.
threshold or the examples that I have given it's the nature of the function itself right and I'll tell you.
