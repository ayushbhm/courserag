foreign [Music] data as D which contains M plus n points where you have M ah or other n training.
points and M test points right or the other way around as we defined on the previous slide now we.
also know that ah some true function exists such that Y is f of x plus Epsilon what does that.
mean that Y is is related to x i by some true function f but there is also some noise.
Epsilon in the relationship right just like in any in relation that you might have some noise so you ideally.
want Y is equal to f of x but there might be some minor noise and for Simplicity we assume.
that this noise is zero Center that means it has zero mean and a small variance Sigma square right so.
that's what we are going to assume and of course we do not know F right if you knew F.
then there's nothing to do but we don't know f so what we do is we approximate f using F.
hat and then we estimate the F hat the parameters of f hat using uh the training data which is.
