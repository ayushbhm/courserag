right now today what we are going to do is we are going to look at various variants of the.
gradient descent algorithm and so to do that we'll first start with quickly revising the gradient descent algorithm that we.
had done and then we'll point out some peculiarities that we see there and then we'll keep trying to fix.
those peculiarities right we'll say okay this looks bad let's try to work around it we'll propose something new then.
we'll say okay this is fine but this has some other problems let's try to fix that fix that and.
it'll keep going to a series of uh algorithms which are all variants of the basic gradient descent algorithm okay.
so that's the agenda so with that the first 5-10 minutes is going to be like at a Brisk Pace.
where I have these around 30 slides on gradient descent which we have already covered uh in the lecture three.
uh like lecture three meaning the slide which had the title lecture three uh so those I'm going to rush.
