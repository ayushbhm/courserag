0.099 that's the loss if it was perfect the loss would have been zero right but this is 0.099 so.
that's how bad this is now i am able to quantify my answer using the loss value if you give.
me a w comma b i can tell you how bad that is right that's right what i am able.
to do right now we want the loss to be as close to zero as possible ideally zero but as.
i said i would settle for approximately zero also right so that's what we want to do so let us.
try some other values of w comma b right and we'll change we'll use the slider to change it okay.
so first i'll try uh let me just see if i can do that so first i'm going to try.
w is equal to 0.5 okay okay this is 0.5 and b is equal to 0 right so let me.
just oh for some reason i'm not able to change it okay so suppose i do w is equal to.
0.5 and b is equal to minus 1 right this is also bad and how bad is it it's saying.
it's 0.121 right so earlier my loss was 0.09 now my loss is 0.121 right so it's even worse right.
