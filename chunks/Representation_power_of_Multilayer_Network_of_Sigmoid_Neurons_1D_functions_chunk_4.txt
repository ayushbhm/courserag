a network I don't know what the network looks like and the network is going to give me a certain.
output let me call that g of X so far I've been calling it at F hat of X and.
is calling in G of X right and I know that there is some true function also such that when.
I take this input and pass it through the two function I get the output as f of x what.
I am saying is that what this statement is saying that I can come up with any network I can.
come up with a network such that the difference between the true output okay this is how I'm quantifying the.
difference I'm just taking the difference between these two values if these are real numbers I'm just talking about the.
absolute uh difference uh between those two real numbers right would be less than Epsilon okay so I would be.
able to approximate it up to the Precision of Epsilon for any of the inputs that are possible I'll pass.
it through my network I'll get a g of X and I am confident that it will not deviate from.
