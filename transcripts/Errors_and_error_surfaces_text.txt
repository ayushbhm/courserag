foreign [Music] I just started talking a bit about errors I was moving the line a bit and saying over here we're making a few errors and so on let's let's just dig a bit deeper in this concept of errors and I'll also introduce error surfaces which will again stay with us for a long time in the course right today we'll see something which is Trivial but this error surface or lost surface will keep reefers resurfacing and we'll see it quite often in the course at least in the initial part of the course right uh so again this is the example we were dealing with so now I'm looking at the uh and function now okay and for the and function the output should be one only for one input which is shown in green here and it should be 0 for the three red inputs right that's what the and function is and now my uh decision is of course W1 it's uh sorry yeah so it's w naught plus W1 X1 plus W 2 x 2 greater than equal to 0 then the output would be 1 otherwise it would be zero right so now let me just fix this as W naught s minus one right so that is what I have done here so my w naught is fixed to minus 1 okay again I did the same thing okay okay so w naught is minus one and I will try different values of w one W two right so it just so happens that the first value that I tried was W one equal to minus 1 w t equal to minus 1 and that is the line that I have drawn here so this since W naught is minus 1 of course the Y intercept is minus 1 and then I have minus x 1 minus x 2 and this is the line that I get now what is wrong with this line yeah so obviously if you look at the negative half space of the line which is shown in the red region right and now this is an example where it's clear that it's not always correct to say lies above the line right because these are all points which are lying above the line but they are actually in the negative half space so above and below does not really Define negative and positive half space it simply boils down to equation the inequality right so minus 1 minus ah x 2 minus sorry let me just erase this and write it properly yeah so this is the equation of the line so all the points which satisfy this greater than equal to 0 lie in the positive half space and this happen to be those points or the points in this region and all the points which satisfy the inequality less than 0 are in the negative half space and it so happens that this entire red region is those points right so it's not above or below it's about ah whether greater than equal to zero or less than equal to zero which of these inequalities is satisfied okay so these these points line the negative half space as shown in the red region and then of course one of the points which should not have been in the negative half space which is the point one comma 1 is lying in the negative half space so with these particular values of the perceptron or the weights of the perceptron function I am making error on one of the four inputs right so if I just want to tabulate so I took the W and W2 values as minus 1 minus 1 and then I made an error of one of the inputs now let me take the values 1.5 and 0 okay let me try those values so I will oops yeah I'll make this as 1.5 ok so this is 1.5 and I want W2 to be 0 so I'll just make it 0. okay so this is the line that I get and I do not of course I have fixed at minus one and again you can see the negative and the positive half spaces so I'm again making an error of 1 it's a different error this time one of the points which should have been in the negative half space which is this point uh is actually in the positive half space now right so again I made an error of one now let us try a different value of w one W two so I will take the values 10 and minus 10 right so I'll just make this 10 and I'll make this as minus 10 okay now this is what is happening right so again uh I'm making an error of 2 because one of the red points is in the positive half space and the Green Point is actually in the negative half space right so only these two red points uh which are 0 1 and 0 0 have actually been ah are in the right place right they are in the negative half space and they should be in the negative half space but the other two points I am making so what is happening here is that as I'm changing the value of w and W 2 the error or the number of Errors is changing right so now I can think of error itself why is this not working yeah I can think of error as a function of w 1 W 2 because I have fixed W naught right and depending on the values of w 1 W 2 y that I try the error is changing so now I think of error as a function of W1 W2 and now once you have digested that idea we are ready for the next slide where I have error which is on the Z axis okay as a function of let me just try to see if I can zoom into this yeah so error is a function of W1 and W 2 right so this is my W1 this is my W2 and along the Z axis I am plotting the error and what are the values that the error function can take integer values right it can either be zero error one error two error or three errors right those are the values that it can take so that is why you see this step function here so for certain values of w the error would be 0 which is the dark blue region for certain values it would be 1 which is the purple region for certain values it would be 2 which is the orange region and for certain values it would be 3 which is the yellow region right so that's those so now what I have done is I've taken all possible values of oops yeah I've taken all possible values of w one W two I've just restricted to minus four to plus 4 because that's all I can show on the plot and this and I have substituted that those values in the equation and then just counted the number of errors that I made so we were doing that visually but I could just write a program to calculate those errors and that's how the code there was displaying it there was two errors one errors and so on and now these are the set of values for w and W2 if I plug in these values and you can go back and check them the error would be 0. these are here right these are the values of w one and ah W 2 right for which the error is going to be 1 and so on 2 and 3. so what I have done here is I have actually ah yeah so the question here is for this particular case can the error not be 4 right so now you can see so any line that you draw okay so the only possibilities are that all the Four Points lie in the uh in the positive half space in which case you would be making an error on three points or all the Four Points lie in the negative half space that's the worst case scenario right in which case you will be making an error on three points right because one one of the two things would be right right I mean it would either be the positive point would be correct or the negative points will be correct so that's why it can be only maximum three you cannot make an error on all the Four Points um okay so now what I've done here actually is just uh plotted the error for all possible values of w one W two and now from the plot I can see which are the values which are useful right and I can just pick any of those W and W2 values which correspond to that dark blue region of the plot right ah so this is what we have done but this is okay visually to do but ideally we would want an algorithm such that I don't now I can plot this visually for two inputs right but if I had n inputs I can't even plot and visualize it right so now I'm looking for an algorithm just as visually by looking at this plot I can find out what they write w and W two values are can I have an algorithm which allows me to find one such W one W two such that if my input is linearly separable then for that value of w and W 2 my positive points would be on the right side and my negative side points would also be on the right side right on the correct side or in the right half space right so that's the algorithm that we are looking for and that's the perceptron learning algorithm that we will see in the next module thank you
