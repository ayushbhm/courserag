[Music] hi everyone so welcome to lecture two uh in this lecture we are going to talk about uh different neurons mcculloch pits neuron thresholding logic perceptrons and even look at the learning algorithm for perceptrons and see a small proof on why that algorithm would converge and then we'll end with what we call as multi-layer perceptrons or mlps which you would have popularly heard of and what is the representation power of such mlps right so let's uh start with the first module and we'll start with biological neurons right so why biological neurons right so what we are interested in knowing about is what is known as an artificial neuron which is the most fundamental unit in an artificial neural network right but now why the term artificial neuron right so where does this inspiration come from so the inspiration actually comes from biology so i think you remember when we were talking about history we had talked about these biological neurons and the term neurons getting coined somewhere in 1890s which was the processing unit in the brain right and the idea is just as we have this neurons in the brain which can do fairly complex processing can we have artificial neurons which can also help us do some computational processing right so that's where the inspiration comes from so let's just look at what a biological neuron looks like so here's a picture i'm showing two neurons here i'll go through some important parts of the neuron so you have a dendrite right which receives signals from other neurons these neurons are connected as we had seen in the history again and then there's the synapse which is the point of connection of the two neurons so dendrite is the part from which one neuron receives signals from the other neurons and the point of connection is called synapse and then you have soma which is the kind of you could think of with the central processing unit where all the information gets processed and then you have the axon once the information has been persist the exon is responsible for uh carrying it out to the other neurons right so dendrite to receive signals then synapse is the point of connection between neurons soma is where the processing happens in the neurons and exons is where you give the output out or transmit the output to the other neuron so this is what a biological neuron looks like right and let's see like a very cartoonish illustration of how this uh works and how a neuron works right so our uh sense organs they interact with uh the outside world right so we see we hear and so on so now let's assume you're watching some uh a cartoon or if you're watching some uh comedy uh movie or serial right and let's in this case it's uh you're watching something from sheldon and then your eyes are seeing it your ears are hearing it let me just get rid of this so they then relay information to the neurons here i am just showing a single neuron on the next slide i will show you that it's not just one neuron but a network of neurons but let's just go with this right so the neuron receives signals from the sensory organs it processes it and then it might decide to take an action right so in this case if the neuron is excited enough if this is really something very comical then it might uh get activated and in turn signal to the other neurons that hey we need to do something to evoke loft right so that's a very cartoonish illustration and i said in reality it's not just like a single neuron but it's like a network of neurons that you have and these neurons are arranged in layers so that initial set of neurons at the lowest level which interact with the sensory organs and then they get some input and then based on that input some of them might get excited and pass activate other neurons in other layers and this might continue till finally a response is a physical response is evoked and and in this case that response could be laughter right so the main takeaway here is that there's like this massive network of interconnected neurons which are interacting with each other arranged in layers one layer activating the neurons in the other layer and so on and this layered architecture is something that we'll see frequently through the course right and when i say it's a massively parallel interconnected network i really mean it right because it has the average human brain has around 10 raised to 11 that is 100 billion neurons right and in this massive network there's also natural division of work right so each neuron may not perform all the tasks that humans perform like each neuron may not be responsible for processing visual information as well as auditory information as well as other information right it might just take care of certain information right and one way to demonstrate uh this so i'll just first again illustrate with the cartoon and then go to a more real example is that you might have this neuron which fires only if the visual is funny there might be other neurons which fires only if the speech or the sound is funny right and another neuron which might fire if the text is funny that means whatever is being said is funny and then you might these three neurons might pass on the information to a fourth neuron and that neuron might fire if at least two of the three inputs are on right if two of the three inputs are activated then this is enough for it to fire and it in it turn would do some other action right it might just activate other neurons or might directly be responsible for taking some action right and here i'd like to demonstrate the visual cortex right of the brain right and it has many layers let me just delete this and then do it again yes so here you have the retinas as you're saying this interacts with the outside world and it will be like it's the input that you are receiving right and then this input as you can follow the arrows it will pass through different layers in the brain right and each layer might do some amount of processing and then pass it on to the other layer so you can process the flow and then finally after going through several layers you can follow the arrows that you have here it finally generates some action and this goes to the spinal cord and in this case it might just be to move the hand right you're seeing something in response to which you want to move your hand right so that's how information gets processed across multiple layers and now i'll focus on these red parts here right which are labeled as v1 v2 uh v4 right and i'll tell you a bit about uh what they do right again a very simplified uh explanation of what they try to do right so here layer one might just be responsible for detecting edges and corners so i'm looking at people sitting in front of me and this layer might just tell me okay there are some dots there are some edges and that's all that's all the information it will process i'll pass on this information to the next layer and this next layer might now start looking at this information in a more organized or grouped manner that there are feature groups or these two edges together seem to form a nose these two edges together seem to form eyes and these two sorry these two edges form a mouth and these two dots were actually eyes and the next layer might again look at bigger objects coming out from these smaller groups here all of these combine to make a face actually right so this is how each layer is processed doing a different job and each layer is also doing more and more complex processing or doing more abstraction of the input that was passed right so this is a very touch explanation of how the human brain works and that's the main takeaways here is that you have a massively parallel interconnected network of neurons there are many layers there are neurons which might do spatial things and then pass it on to other neurons and information flows from one layer to another that's the main takeaways as far as the deep learning course is concerned or as far as artificial neural networks are concerned right and as you can read the disclaimers on this on this slide i know i know very little about how the human brain works and whatever explanation i have given while is not suitable for any biology course it suffices for the purpose of this course so with that disclaimer i'll end this video here and i'll come back and talk to you in module 2.
